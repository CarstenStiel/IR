Much of this progress can be attributed to the vast amounts of textual data that have become available and to a concomitant weakening of theoretical commitments, so as to be able to use the data in information extraction, sentiment analysis, question answering, etc. Along with weakened commitments to the demands of particular theories, has been a greater willingness to consider what can be learned from textual data and from various forms of annotation, in English and in other languages as well. This paper briefly summarizes (1) changing assumptions about discourse structure; (2) recent work on lexico-syntactic grounding of low-level discourse structure and frameworks for higher-level discourse structure that recognize differences in genre; and (3) suggestions for addressing some of the challenges still facing us.

The choice of software may have a great influence not only on the research process but also on the derived findings, e.g. when errors in the used software lead to incorrect computations or biases. In order to increase transparency of research and verifiability of findings, knowledge of the used software thus is crucial. However, explicit links between publications and used software are usually not available. In addition, software is, unlike literature, often not cited in a standardized way which makes the automatic generation of links difficult. While recent Named Entity Recognition (NER) approaches yield excellent results for a wide range of use-cases and tasks, they typically require large sets of annotated data which may be hard to acquire. In this paper, we investigate the use of weakly supervised approaches with distant supervision to create silver labels to train supervised software mention extraction methods using transfer learning. We show that by combining even only a small number of weakly supervised approaches, a silver standard corpus can be created that serves as a useful basis for transfer learning.

While the influence of citations in finding seminal papers has been analysed thoroughly, semantic features of citation networks are regarded with less vigour. In this paper, we revaluate the ideas of semantometrics presented by Herrmannova et al.[9,13] to learn patterns of features extracted from publication distances in their citation networks aiming at distinguishing between seminal and survey papers in the area of computer science. For the evaluation, we present the SeminalSurveyDBLP dataset. By using different document content representations, the incorporation of semantic distance measures, as well as multiple machine learning algorithms for the classification, we achieved an accuracy of up to 0.8015 on our dataset. Earlier findings in this area suggest features extracted from references to be more suitable proxies whereas we observed the contrasting importance of features describing citation information.

This paper tackles this challenge, specifically, we extract references embedded in USPTO patent full texts and match them to Web of Science (WoS) publications. We approach the reference extraction problem as a sequence labelling task, training CRF and Flair models. We then match references to the WoS using regular expression patterns. We train and evaluate the reference extraction models using cross validation on a sample of 22 patents with 1,952 manually annotated in-text references. Then we apply the models to a large collection of 33,338 biotech patents. We find that CRF obtains better results on citation extraction than Flair, with precision scores of around 90% and recall of around 85%. However, Flair extracts much more references from the large collection than CRF, and more of those can be matched to WoS publications. We find that 88% of the extracted in-text references are not listed on patent front page, suggesting distinct roles played by in-text and front-page references. CRF and Flair collectively extract 603,457 references to WoS publications that are not listed on the front page. In addition to the 1.17 Million front-page references in the collection, this is a 51% increase in identified patent-publication links compared with only relying on frontpage references.

In recent years, the volume of available information has significantly increased, partly due to technological advancements and partly due to pressures on academics to 'publish or perish'. This amount of papers presents a challenge not only for the peer-review process but also for readers, particularly inexperienced readers, to find publications of high quality. Whilst one might rely on citation or journal rankings to help guide this decision, this approach may not be completely reliable due to biased peer-review processes and the fact that the citation count of an article does not per se indicate its quality. Here, we analyse how expected author intentions in a Related Work section can be used to indicate its quality. We show that author intentions can predict the quality with reasonable accuracy and propose that similar approaches could be used in other sections to provide an overall picture of quality. This approach could be useful in supporting peer-review processes and for a reader in prioritising articles to read. Can Models of Author Intention Support Quality Assessment of Content?"}

Several approaches are attempting to reduce the workload of physicians who need to screen and label hundreds or thousands of documents in order to answer specific clinical questions. Previous works have attempted to semi-automate document screening, reporting promising results, but their evaluation is conducted using small datasets, which hinders generalization. Moreover, some recent works have used recently introduced neural language models, but no previous work have compared, for this task, the performance of different language models based on neural word embeddings, which have reported good results in the latest years for several NLP tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two popular neural word embeddings (Word2vec and GloVe) in an active learning-based setting for document screening in EBM, with the goal of reducing the number of documents that physicians need to label in order to answer clinical questions. We evaluate these methods in a small public dataset (HealthCLEF 2017) as well as a larger one (Epistemonikos). Our experiments indicate that Word2vec have less variance and better general performance than GloVe when using active learning strategies based on uncertainty sampling.

In science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), researchers cite less often but employ mathematical concepts to refer to prior knowledge (Moed et al.). Our long-term goal is to generalize citation-based IR-methods and apply the generalized method to both classical references and mathematical concepts. In this paper, we suggest how mathematical formulae could be cited and define a Formula Concept Retrieval challenge with two subtasks: Formula Concept Discovery (FCD) and Formula Concept Recognition (FCR). While the former aims at the definition and exploration of a Formula Concept that names bundled equivalent representations of a formula, the latter is designed to match a given formula to a prior assigned concept ID. Moreover, we present first Machine Learning based approaches to tackle the FCD and FCR tasks, which we apply to a standardized test-collection (NTCIR arXiv dataset). Our FCD approach yields a recall of 68% for retrieving equivalent representations of frequent formulae, and 72% for extracting the formula name from the surrounding text. FCD and FCR will enable citing formulae within mathematical documents and facilitate semantic search as well as similarity computations for plagiarism detection or document recommender systems.

We specifically attempt the first task, targeting in building an improved recall system of reference text spans from a given citing research paper (Task 1A) and constructing better models for comprehension of scientific facets (Task 1B). Our architecture incorporates transfer learning by utilising a combination of pretrained embeddings which are subsequently used for building models for the given tasks. In particular-for task 1A, we locate the related text spans referred to by the citation text by creating paired text representations and employ pre-trained embedding mechanisms in conjunction with XGBoost, a gradient boosted decision tree algorithm to identify textual entailment. For task 1B, we make use of the same pretrained embeddings and use the RAKEL algorithm for multi-label classification. Our goal is to enable better scientific research comprehension and we believe that a new approach involving transfer learning will certainly add value to the research community working on these tasks.

However, the demographic information and a variety of user behavior logs are high dimensional,noisy, and increasingly complex, which are challenging to extract suitable user profiles. Usually, rule-based and similaritybased approaches are proposed to profile the users' interests and expand the audience. However, they are specific and limited in more complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end solution, unifying the feature extraction and profile prediction stages. Specifically, we present a neural prediction framework and leverage it with the intuitive audience feature extraction stages. We conduct extensive study on a real and large advertisement dataset.

In the e-commerce domain, user's product search queries can be broadly categorised into product specific queries and category specific queries [9]. In these instances, accurate classification of queries will help with identifying the right product categories from which relevant products can be retrieved. Thus, mapping a query to a pre-defined product taxonomy is an important step in e-commerce query understanding pipeline. A typical e-commerce website has thousands of categories, and curating a labeled data set for query classification is expensive, time consuming, and labor intensive. In addition, product search queries are short, and the vocabulary changes over time as the catalogue evolves. Reducing this effort of generating query-category labels would save time and resources. In this work we show how an existing product-taxonomy mapping can improve query classification, and reduce the need for labeled data, using transfer learning. Our results demonstrate that such an approach can match, and often exceed, the performance of direct training with a smaller computational budget. We further explore how performance varies as the amount of available training data varies, and show that transfer learning is most useful when the target data set size is small. In addition, we make available a large query data set of 535, 506 unique e-commerce labeled queries, mapped over 58 categories. The results and transfer learning approaches presented in this work can act as strong baselines for this collection and task.

Retrieving relevant products in an E-Commerce (EC) website is of the utmost importance, as a single EC website can have millions of products with very similar features. One aspect that is not widely studied in this scenario is the effect that the image of the product (notably aesthetic properties) shown to the customer has on the customer's interest. Previous studies have been able to link certain characteristics of images to our innate interest. For instance, it is known that bright images with several colors are more likely to attract one's attention than dark ones. However, these issues have been understudied in the EC context. In this context, we conduct experiments on real-world EC to analyze the effects that the product's image aesthetic has on the user interest (expressed in clicks) in the product.

In contrast to web search, the retrieved results in product search not only need to be relevant but also should satisfy customers' preferences in order to elicit purchases. Previous work has shown the efficacy of purchase history in personalized product search [3]. However, customers with little or no purchase history do not benefit from personalized product search. Furthermore, preferences extracted from a customer's purchase history are usually long-term and may not always align with her short-term interests. Hence, in this paper, we leverage clicks within a query session, as implicit feedback, to represent users' hidden intents, which further act as the basis for re-ranking subsequent result pages for the query. It has been studied extensively to model user preference with implicit feedback in recommendation tasks. However, there has been little research on modeling users' short-term interest in product search. We study whether short-term context could help promote users' ideal item in the following result pages for a query. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end context-aware embedding model which can capture long-term and short-term context dependencies. Our experimental results on the datasets collected from the search log of a commercial product search engine show that short-term context leads to much better performance compared with long-term and no context. Our results also show that our proposed model is more effective than word-based context-aware models. Leverage Implicit Feedback for Context-aware Product Search"}

In the context of a product search engine, an effective spell correction system can improve the accuracy of the search results and reduce the occurrence of No Results Found (NRF). Conversely, a sub-optimal spell correction has negative effects, e.g., failing to correct misspelled queries, modifying correct queries into wrong ones. In this paper, three novel components / algorithms currently used in The Home Depot (THD) spell correction service is presented: (1) word embedding based dictionary construction; (2) multi-path candidates generation; (3) high dimensional cluster analysis based ranking model. The dictionary provides data about the inner relationships among the words for a given corpus. With the dictionary, the candidate generation algorithm recommends a set of correction candidates for several misspelling hypothesis, e.g., word editing error, word breaking error, word concatenation error, fat finger typing error, and so on. Then the ranking model projects the candidates into a high dimensional space and sorts them based on cluster density analysis. In the experiment, the new THD spell correction is compared with the old version (without these features), Lucene spell correction and Grammarly spell correction.

The off-the-shelf solutions cannot handle such complex objectives and therefore, modelers are left hand-tuning of parameters that have only indirect impact to the objectives, attempting to incorporate multiple objectives (MO) in a model. This process is time-consuming and tends to face sub-optimality. The proposed method is designed to systematically solve the MO problem in a constrained optimization framework, which is integrated with a popular Boosting algorithm and is, by all means, a novel contribution. Furthermore, we propose a procedure to specify the constraints to achieve business goals and the exploration scales linearly in the number of constraints, while existing methodology can scale exponentially.

While methods for optimizing each type of results in isolation have been extensively studied, selective presentation of these two types to optimize overall performance has been largely unexplored. Our work aims to address this allocation challenge at Marktplaats.nl, one of the largest sites in the ebay classifieds group. To this end, we explore the interplay between organic and sponsored results across a variety of item categories while reflecting on findings by previous works. We hypothesize that in categories of niche items, such as Ponies, organic results perform better than sponsored results, while in categories of commoditized items, such as Batteries, the opposite is true. Based on our findings, we propose a simple and adaptive allocation model to improve the overall CTR performance. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of our model, compared to the existing method in production, with a significantly higher click-through rate for both organic and sponsored results.

It is the process of altering and enhancing raw user queries using synonymous keywords or structured metadata to improve search recall and relevance using data mining techniques applied on textual data and user behavioral signals. For example, the query bicycle is rewritten to match (bicycle OR bike)-i.e. all items that either contain the word bicycle or bike in their title are returned for this query. Choosing the right set of synonymous terms for a given query term is essential to ensure the quality of search results, especially in the context of e-commerce where buyer needs can be very specific. As an example, shoe is a good synonym for shoes, whereas sandals, while related, is not a good synonym for shoes. In this work, we describe one version of the approaches to query rewriting taken at eBay search. At a high level, we use a two step process to generate and apply synonyms for query expansions-1. offline token level synonym generation and 2. runtime search query rewriting. In the offline phase, we first generate a large pool of candidate synonyms for query tokens using various techniques leveraging user behavioral data, inventory and taxonomy information and open source knowledge bases; then, we leverage a machine learned binary classifier t rained o n h uman j udged b inary r elevance l abels t o filter the candidate synonyms that are truly useful as query expansions without compromising result set precision; this classifier allows us to leverage a wide variety of sources and techniques to generate synonym candidates by providing a scientific and scalable method to evaluate their effectiveness for query rewriting.

In the online phase, we rewrite user search queries by combining the token level synonyms in the dictionary, creating a boolean recall expression.

The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a network of investigative reporters across 45 countries that uncovers cases of bribery, theft and money laundering around the world. To support this, OCCRP has built a unique data resource covering more than a billion entities from over 400 data sources, and a suite of open-source data integration and search tools, the Aleph. This allows us to give investigative reporters visibility into large amounts of evidence, and to perform cross-referencing between databases that uncovers evidence of wrongdoing.

Hodson', 'James Y. Zhang'] [] SIGIR 2014.sigirconf_workshop-2014erd.1 1541498842.0 ABSTRACTThe task of disambiguation in the financial and business domain is nuanced, covering a variety of pseudo-textual sources from news headlines to company earnings calls, automated telephone announcements, instant messaging, emails, and legal documents. New entities and references are continuously created as a matter of pride, and tracking the evolution of mentions through time and context can be just as important as interpreting a single instance.The process of disambiguation is often considered as a canonical problem of resolving entity-mentions into a complete-by-design Knowledge Base (KB). This construction of the problem ignores or obscures the relationship between the phases of entity recognition and resolution, each of which depends heavily on the full stack of Natural Language Processing capabilities, from tokenization to Parts-of-Speech tagging, noun chunking, parsing, normalization, co-reference resolution, and the compounding of errors that occurs as each layer introduces different and often opposing subtleties.In this treatment of the disambiguation problem from a financial text perspective, we introduce what we believe to be a clearer formulation of the disambiguation problem as an ensemble of methods, each designed to address different sub-problems and challenges. Through a thorough analysis of the available data sets, we discover that there are distinct classes of entities that should be treated as such. These range from entities that are for all intents and purposes unambiguous (\"Bloomberg L.P.\", \"World War I\"), to entities that are statistically unlikely to be the argument of a coreferent relationship, are key specifiers for coherence relationships (e.g. \"Juventus\" makes a mention of \"Milan\" much more likely to refer to the soccer team than the city), and many more features that are strong indicators of the kinds of strategies that should be relied on.Aside from the process of building models that capture the subtleties of syntactic, semantic, and logical components of the text and candidate mentions in context, the problem of disambiguation relies heavily on the extrinsic resources made available through the Knowledge Base, the richness of the ontologies or distributional concept representations, and additional sources of information. To this day, there exist a large number of distinct mappings, many of which are well-connected, graphs and dictionaries of linguistic phenomena, huge language models representing much of a language's fertility, and an increasing literature on methods for cross-lingual grounding, to add value in cases where the resources are not so dense or readily available.The challenge of using many different sources falls not only in their design and population, but also in the engineering problem of providing efficient search and retrieval, probabilistic representations, and the ability to dynamically learn from recent experiences. Currently, state-of-the-art disambiguation systems may range from hundreds of milliseconds per entity, to many seconds. Much like syntactic parsing in the 1990's, significant work is needed to increase the adoption of disambiguation systems to solve real world problems where recall is critical. In order to do this, we must break the problem down further, and better understand the parameters and constraints, the information available, and the fruitful strategies in each case.

The objective of the proposed system is to spot mentions of entities in a document and link the mentions to corresponding Freebase articles. To achieve it, Tulip prunes the set of entity candidates focusing on a core subset of related entities capturing the context of the document. The relationship strength is measured as a similarity to a topic centroid generated from entity features. Each entity is represented by an accurate and compact feature vector extracted from a category graph built based on information from 120 language versions of Wikipedia. Given the core set of accepted entities Tulip uses the Wikipedia-based feature vectors to extract more related entities from the document text. Tulip received the first prize in the long document track with F1 score of 0.74, which confirms the effectiveness of our system. At the same, the system was faster than all other submissions with latency under 0.29 seconds. Tulip: lightweight entity recognition and disambiguation using wikipedia-based topic centroids"}

If there are multiple ways to interpret the query, then an ERD system is supposed to group candidate entity annotations into consistent interpretations.In this paper, we propose a four step solution to this problem. First, we generate candidate entity strings by segmenting queries in different ways. Second, we retrieve candidate entities by searching for these candidate entity strings in Freebase. Third, we rank the candidate entities using language model based query likelihood scores. Finally, we group the entity annotations into interpretations. We also present both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our methods based on 91 training, 500 validation and 1000 test queries. Our system achieved an F1 score of 0.42 on the set of validation queries, whereas the NULL baseline which returns no annotations for any query achieved an F1 score of 0.3. Similarly, on the test queries, our method achieved an F1 score of 0.36 and outperformed the NULL baseline which achieved an F1 score of 0.2.

The novelty is twofold: from the one hand, we have engineered the software in order to be modular and more efficient; from the other hand, we have improved the annotation pipeline by re-designing all of its three main modules: spotting, disambiguation and pruning. In particular, the re-design has involved the detailed inspection of the performance of these modules by developing new algorithms which have been in turn tested over all publicly available datasets (i.e. AIDA, IITB, MSN, AQUAINT, and the one of the ERD Challenge).This extensive experimentation allowed us to derive the best combination which achieved on the ERD development dataset an F1 score of 74.8%, which turned to be 67.2% F1 for the test dataset. This final result was due to an impressive precision equal to 87.6%, but very low recall 54.5%. With respect to classic Tagme on the development dataset the improvement ranged from 1% to 9% on the D2W benchmark, depending on the disambiguation algorithm being used.As a side result, the final software can be interpreted as a flexible library of several parsing/disambiguation and pruning modules that can be used to build up new and more sophisticated entity annotators. We plan to release our library to the public as an open-source project. From TagME to WAT: a new entity annotator"}

Our approach combines techniques of information retrieval, gazetteer based annotation and entity link graph analysis to identify and disambiguate candidate entities. We built a search index with multiple structured fields extracted from Wikipedia, Freebase and DBPedia. When processing a query, we first retrieve top matching entities from the index. For all retrieved entities, we gather plausible verbalizations, surface forms, that retrieved entities may be referred to with. We match gathered entity surface forms against the original query to confirm the entity relevance to the query. Finally, we exploit Wikipedia link graph to asses the similarity of candidate entities for the purpose of disambiguation and further candidate filtering.

Their edges correspond to the joint signal between pairs of entities. This facilitates collective disambiguation of the mentions achieved by performing MAP inference on the MRF in a binary label space. Our model also allows for a natural treatment of mentions that either have no entity attached or have more than one attachments.

Hovy'] [] SIGIR 2014.sigirconf_workshop-2014smir.2 1581522299.0 , IR had the good fortune of using a form of distributional semantics, albeit a rather weak one. In fact, one might say that this is the reason IR works. But the time has come to upgrade IR to a more advanced semantics, since that is likely to deliver better results. Distributional semantics, as stated by Firth, is usually anchored on single words: \"you shall know a word by the company it keeps\". A word signature vector, created for every word and using a variety of scoring formulas to compute the association strengths of words that co-occur with it, is the traditional implementation. Such vectors have been used over the past decade in NLP to perform word sense disambiguation, find good translation words, identify paraphrases and coreferences, and other tasks. However, in this form distributional semantics is a misnomer: to be a true semantics it is required that a formal operation of compositionality be defined, allowing two word vectors to be composed into a third that expresses the (distributional) semantics of the composite. In not-truly-semantic distributional semantics, there is no composition. So although we think of \"the capital of New Jersey\" as somehow a composite of the vectors for \"capital\" and \"New Jersey\", there is no representation of the fact that \"of\" signals a specific relationship, or that the non-city senses of \"capital\" (as in money) and associated words should be removed. Thus the resulting vector has little overlap with the vector for \"Trenton\". IR adopted the same form of not-truly-semantic distributional semantics, by representing a document as a distribution of the unstructured bag of [content] words that comprise it, and a query similarly (perhaps extended through relevance feedback), both of which can be implemented by a distributional vector (albeit a sparse one for a query). In the sense of distributional semantics, IR treats these distributions as the 'semantics' of the document or query, and relies upon the mutually disambiguating effects of words to pinpoint the semantics more of less as a side effect: \"bank\"+\"deposit\"+\"money\" is a different vector from \"bank\"+\"deposit\"+\"mud\", and even without making systems try to differentiate the semantics of the senses of \"bank\" and \"deposit\", \"money\" and \"mud\" are different enough to separate out the meanings and reinforce the intended one. Recent research on distributional semantics has devoted quite a lot of attention to the problem of compositionality. It is required for a semantics that smaller meanings can be composed into larger ones that properly express the 'larger' meaning. How large is feasible-a paragraph? a document?-is not yet known. Despite a lot of fancy work, some wild claims about tensors and quantum mechanics, and brave attempts to construct corpora and evaluation tests that would help guide research, it doesn't seem that a satisfactory solution has been found. It is possible today to create distributional structures to represent words and other units Distributional Semantics for IR"}

We will start our talk by pointing out the importance of semantic matching for natural language processing and information retrieval. Most of the tasks in natural language processing and information retrieval, including search, question answering, and machine translation, are based on matching between language expressions. This approach works quite well in practice; its limitation is also obvious, however. Sometimes mismatch can occur. We argue that 'semantic matching' is an effective approach to overcome the challenge, that is to conduct more semantic analysis on the language expressions and perform matching between language expressions at semantic level. We will then introduce the major approaches to semantic matching in search, developed in the research community in recent Semantic Matching in Search"}

In this perspective, matching named entities (NEs) implies that the associated model can both overcomes mismatch between different representations of the same entities, e.g., George H. W. Bush vs. George Bush, and carry out entity disambiguation to avoid incorrect matches between different but similar entities, e.g., the entity above with his son George W. Bush. This means that both the context and structure of NEs must be taken into account in the IR model. SM becomes even more complex when attempting to match the shared semantics between two larger pieces of text, e.g., phrases or clauses, as there is currently no theory indicating how words should be semantically composed for deriving the meaning of text. The complexity above has traditionally led to define IR models based on bag-of-word representations in the vector space model (VSM), where (i) the necessary structure is minimally taken into account by considering n-grams or phrases; and (ii) the matching coverage is increased by projecting text in latent semantic spaces or alternatively by applying query expansion. Such methods introduce a considerable amount of noise, which negatively balances the benefit of achieving better coverage in most cases, thus producing no IR system improvement. In the last decade, a new class of semantic matching approaches based on the so-called Kernel Methods (KMs) for structured data (see e.g., [4]) have been proposed. KMs also adopt scalar products (which, in this context, take the names of kernel functions) in VSM. However, KMs introduce two new important aspects: \u2022 the scalar product is implicitly computed using smart techniques, which enable the use of huge feature spaces, e.g., all possible skip n-grams; and Semantic Matching using Kernel Methods"}

These correspond to what have been called semantic matching, semantic search, and machine reading. In this talk, I will focus on Cold Start Knowledge Base Population (KBP), an approach that we might think of as spanning semantic search and machine reading. In the Cold Start track at the Text Analysis Conference (TAC), the goal of each participating team has been to build systems to automatically \"read\" some coherent (but unanticipated) text collection and then to automatically generate a knowledge base with a pre-specified schema. In this talk, I will describe the evolution of the TAC Cold Start track over the three years since 2012, with a particular focus on what the levels of accuracy and coverage that have been achieved imply for the near-term usefulness of this approach as a basis for supporting information access. I will augment the presentation with a few examples of the application of a broader range of KBP techniques to additional collections.

A completely automated approach to category creation from the underlying collection could be prone to noise. On the other hand, an absolutely manual approach to the creation of categories could be cumbersome and expensive. Through this work, we propose an intermediate solution, in which, a global, collaboratively-developed Knowledge Graph of categories can be adapted to a local document categorization problem over the search collection effectively.

However, many languages lack such processing tools, or they may be inadequate for retrieval due to language evolution. In this paper, we explore the use of Wikipedia redirects to automatically learn morphological equivalence patterns. Character-level alignment of automatically found morphological variants from Wikipedia redirects is used to generate character-level transformations. Then, given a query word, character-level transformations are used to produce morphological equivalents. The proposed method is language independent and can be applied to new languages without need for linguistic knowledge. Though, the performance of this approach may in the aggregate lag behind state-of-the-art stemming (or morphological analysis) for languages with good existing processors, the approach is generally safer than stemming in the sense that if it degrades queries, the degradation is generally marginal. Stemming on the other hand can significantly degrade queries. We show its success for Arabic, English, Hungarian, and Portuguese.

This is critical to the trustworthiness of many intelligent systems that are based on information retrieval and natural language processing techniques, such as question answering or information extraction. We empirically explore three fundamental issues of uncertainty detection: (1) the predictive ability of different learning methods on this task; (2) whether using unlabeled data can lead to a more accurate model; and (3) whether closed-domain training or crossdomain training is better. For these purposes, we adopt two statistical learning approaches to this problem: the commonly used bag-of-words model based on Naive Bayes, and the sequence labeling approach using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We empirically compare between our two approaches as well as externally compare with prior results on the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task 1. Overall, our results are promising: (1) on Wikipedia and biomedical datasets, the HMM model improves over Naive Bayes up to 17.4% and 29.0%, respectively, in terms of absolute F score; (2) compared to CoNLL-2010 systems, our best HMM model achieves 62.9% F score with MLE parameter estimation and 64.0% with EM parameter estimation on Wikipedia dataset, both outperforming the best result (60.2%) of the CoNLL-2010 systems, but our results on the biomedical dataset are less impressive; (3) when the expression ability of a model (e.g., Naive Bayes) is not strong enough, cross-domain training is helpful, and when a model is powerful (e.g., HMM), cross-domain training may produce biased parameters; and (4) under Maximum Likelihood Estimation, combining the unlabeled examples with the labeled helps.

However, the available social network information can be restricted because of the privacy settings of involved users, which in turn would affect the performance of people search. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the privacy issues in people search. We propose simulating different privacy settings with a public social network due to the unavailability of privacy-concerned networks. Our study examines the influences of privacy concerns on the local and global network features, and their impacts on the performance of people search. Our results show that: 1) the privacy concerns of different people in the networks have different influences. People with higher association (i.e. higher degree in a network) have much greater impacts on the performance of people search; 2) local network features are more sensitive to the privacy concerns, especially when such concerns come from high association peoples in the network who are also related to the querying user.

The development and study of any novel techniques such as retrieval models always require extensive experiments over multiple representative data collections. Traditionally, IR evaluation relies on the use of publicly available data, so researchers often download the collections and conduct the evaluation on their servers. However, this would not be a favorable (or even possible) solution to evaluation over the proprietary data due to various privacy concerns. In this paper, we discuss one potential solution to the privacy-preserving evaluation (PPE) for IR models. We first briefly introduce the VIRLab system, and then discuss how to extend the system to enable a controlled data-centric experimental environment for evaluation over proprietary data.

Local mining attempts to label individual QA pair by independently extracting medical concepts from the QA pair itself and mapping them to authenticated terminologies. However, it may suffer from information loss and lower precision, which are caused by the absence of key medical concepts and presence of irrelevant medical concepts. Global learning, on the other hand, works towards enhancing the local mining via collaboratively discovering missing key terminologies and keeping off the irrelevant terminologies by analyzing the social neighbors.

First we crawled MedHelp 1 forum data and considered two types of information: forums data and posts data. Each forum link points to a specific disease and consists of several topics pertaining to that disease. Each topic consists of multiple posts that carry either users' queries/difficulties or doctor's feedback pertaining to the issue(s) of the users. We use graph based exploration on the terms (diseases) and their relations (in terms of causes/effects) and explore the information geometry pertaining to similar diseases. We performed a systematic evaluation to identify the relevance of the contextual information retrieved for a specific disease and similar factors across different diseases.

With a continuous flood of posts, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) have to effectively handle millions of user queries that aim to search and follow recent developments of news or events. While predicting the quality of retrieved documents against search queries was extensively studied in domains such as the Web and news, the different nature of data and search task in microblogs triggers the need for re-visiting the problem in that context. In this work, we re-examined several state-of-the-art query performance predictors in the domain of microblog ad-hoc search using the two most-commonly used tweets collections with three different retrieval models that are used in microblog search.Our experiments showed that a temporal predictor was generally the best to fit the prediction task in the context of microblog search, indicating the importance of the temporal aspect in this task. The results also highlighted the need to either re-design some of the existing predictors or propose new ones to function effectively with different retrieval models that are used in our tested domain. Finally, our experiments on combining multiple predictors resulted in achieving considerable improvements in prediction quality over individual predictors, which confirmed the results reported in the literature but in different domains.

Many research studies investigated different approaches for microblog retrieval. Query expansion is one of the approaches that showed stable performance for improving microblog retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we comprehensively investigate query expansion for microblog retrieval using pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) with different configurations. In addition, we propose a hyperlink-extended PRF by expanding queries using embedded hyperlinks in retrieved microblogs. Our experimental results on TREC microblog data showed that PRF alone could outperform many retrieval approaches if configured properly. Results also showed that utilizing hyperlinked documents in tweets for query expansion improves results over traditional PRF. Our best results achieved using hyperlink-extended PRF outperformed most of the reported results using other approaches.

Extracting information for health related applications however is less justified especially because of sensitivity of health issues, difficulty in establishing the value and trust in lay people to judge their health problems. Using social media to discover adverse drug reactions is one of the most controversial topics. It is difficult to establish the causality between an adverse drug reaction and a drug when the context information such as patient condition is missing.

Extracting information on drugs, adverse drug reactions, diseases and symptoms, or patient demographics from such media is an essential step of this process, but it is not straightforward. While most studies in this area use a lexicon-based information extraction methodology, they do not explicitly evaluate the impact of text-processing steps on their final results. We experimentally quantify the value of the most popular techniques to establish whether or not they benefit the information extraction process.

Yet existing approaches mostly focused on using a single ranker to learn some better ranking function with respect to various relevance features. Given various available rank learners (such as learning to rank algorithms), in this work, we mainly study an orthogonal problem where multiple learned ranking models form an ensemble for re-ranking the retrieved tweets than just using a single ranking model in order to achieve higher search effectiveness. We explore the use of query-sensitive model selection and rank fusion methods based on the result lists produced from multiple rank learners. Base on the TREC microblog datasets, we found that our selection-based ensemble approach can significantly outperform using the single best ranker, and it also has clear advantage over the rank fusion that combines the results of all the available models.

This paper presents our research on identifying the time zone where listeners are by analysing their weekly aggregated music listening profiles. We collected a large dataset of full music listening histories (N=594K) of users of the Last.fm's scrobbler service from all around the globe, and formulated six approaches for identifying the time zone where these listening profiles have been generated based on their listeners' behaviour. The performance of these approaches was compared with a manually labelled dataset of listening profiles' time zones. We found that the best method was based on the assumption that people, in general, sleep during night time and submit fewer music logs. This approach, implemented by estimating the local minima of people's weekly aggregated listening profile, resulted in a 75 percent correctly identified time zones with a tolerance of \u00b11 hour.

Arabic Dialects (AD) or daily language differs from MSA especially in social media communication. However, most Arabic social media texts have mixed forms and many variations especially between MSA and AD. This paper aims to bridge the gap between MSA and AD by providing a framework for AD classification using probabilistic models across social media datasets. We present a set of experiments using the character n-gram Markov language model and Naive Bayes classifiers with detailed examination of what models perform best under different conditions in social media context. Experimental results show that Naive Bayes classifier based on character bi-gram model can identify the 18 different Arabic dialects with a considerable overall accuracy of 98%.

However, most of these approaches are applied to either topic-independent networks, or more topic-dependent networks which still contain topic-irrelevant users as nodes and interactions as edges. Therefore, authority estimation over these graphs is still not topic-specific enough. This paper proposes a more topic-focused authority network construction approach which provides more effective topic-specific authority modeling of users. Focusing the computational effort to more topic-specific authority networks also leads to significant gains in running time for authority estimation.

Twitter is one of the most popular microblogs. Twitter users often use hashtags to mark specific topics and to link them with related tweets. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the music listening behaviors of Twitter users and a popular music ranking service by comparing information extracted from tweets with music-related hashtags and the Billboard chart. We collect users' music listening behavior from Twitter using music-related hashtags (e.g., #nowplaying). We then build a predictive model to forecast the Billboard rankings and hit music. The results show that the numbers of daily tweets about a specific song and artist can be effectively used to predict Billboard rankings and hits. This research suggests that users' music listening behavior on Twitter is highly correlated with general music trends and could play an important role in understanding consumers' music consumption patterns. In addition, we believe that Twitter users' music listening behavior can be applied in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). #nowplaying the future billboard: mining music listening behaviors of twitter users for hit song prediction"}

We specifically focus on Twitter. Since short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences, and they often contain abbreviations and acronyms, traditional classification methods such as \"Bag-of-Words\" have limitations. Our proposed method enriches the original text with a new set of words, to add more semantic value by using information extracted from webpages of the same temporal context. Then we use those words to query Wikipedia, as an external knowledge base, with the final goal to categorize the original text using a predefined set of Wikipedia categories. We also present a first experimental evaluation that confirms the effectiveness of the algorithm design and implementation choices, highlighting some critical issues with short texts.

While this question is traditionally answered using simple metrics like query click-through rate (CTR), we observe that in ecommerce search, such metrics can be misleading. Upon inspection, we nd cases where CTR is high but the results are poor and vice versa. Similar cases exist for other metrics like time to click which are o en also used for evaluating search engines. We aim to learn the quality of the results served by the search engine based on users' interactions with the results. Although this problem has been studied in the web search context, this is the rst study for e-commerce search, to the best of our knowledge. Despite certain commonalities with evaluating web search engines, there are several major di erences such as underlying reasons for search failure, and availability of rich user interaction data with products (e.g. adding a product to the cart).

Identifying attributes in a query is a critical component in connecting users to relevant items. However, in many cases, the queries have multiple attributes, and some of them will be in conflict with each other. For example, the query \"maroon 5 dvds\" has two candidate attributes, the color \"maroon\" or the band \"maroon 5\", where only one of the attributes can be present. In this paper, we address the problem of resolving conflicting attributes in e-commerce queries. A challenge in this problem is that knowledge bases like Wikipedia that are used to understand web queries are not focused on the e-commerce domain. E-commerce search engines, however, have access to the catalog which contains detailed information about the items and its attributes. We propose a framework that leverages catalog information to resolve conflicting attributes in e-commerce queries.

Claims of missing-items is one such challenge, where customer claims that main product is missing from shipment through return comments. It is observed that dominant part of such claims are inadvertent given the limited literacy of customers. Some of them have fraud intent. At Flipkart, such claims are evaluated manually to examine whether the comment relates to missing item. Classification of the claim intent automatically saves human bandwidth and provides good customer experience by reducing the turn around time to customers. However, this is challenging as comments are replete with spell variations, non-English vernacular words, and are often incomplete and short. This is compounded by noisy labeling of such comments due to human bias and manual errors. To classify the claim intent, we apply conventional as well as deep learning methods. To handle label noise, we employed stateof-the-art noise-aware techniques, which fail to perform due to pattern specific label noise. Motivated by the wide pattern specific label noise, we encode domain heuristics as labeling functions (LFs) which label subsets of the data. However, LFs may conflict and prone to noise. We address the conflict by defining a conflict-score to rank the LFs. Proposed method of noise handling with LFs out performs all the state-of-the-art noise-aware baselines.

In this paper, we formally establish the lifecycle model for products, by defining the introduction, growth, maturity and decline stages and their transitions throughout the whole life period. Based on such model, we further propose a reinforcement learning based mechanism design framework for impression allocation, which incorporates the first principal component based permutation and the novel experiences generation method, to maximize short-term as well as long-term return of the platform. With the power of trial-and-error, it is possible to optimize impression allocation strategies globally which is contribute to the healthy development of participants and the platform itself.

One of the primary challenges constitutes optimizing multiple objectives involving business metrics such as sales and revenue and maintaining a discovery strategy for the site. In this paper, we formalize the e-com search problem for optimizing metrics based on sales, revenue, and relevance. We define a notion of item discoverability in search and show that learning to rank (LTR) algorithms trained with behavioral features from e-com customer interactions (eg. clicks,cart-adds, orders etc.) do not by themselves address the discoverability problem. Instead, a suitable explore-exploit framework must be integrated with the ranking algorithm. We thus construct a practical discovery strategy by keeping a few top positions for discovery and populating some of the items selected through exploration. Then, we present a few exploration strategies with low regret bounds in terms of business metrics. We conduct a simulation study with a synthetically generated dataset that represents items with different utility distribution and compares these strategies using metrics based on sales, revenue, relevance, and discovery. We find that a strategy based on adaptive submodular function based discovery framework can provide a nice balance of business metrics and discoverability compared to other strategies based on random exploration or multi-armed bandit. However, another strategy, based on monotonic submodular optimization function that needs to be integrated with linear LTR models also works well for discovery and has nice performances with respect to sales, revenue, and relevance.

As far as we know, this is the first time such a system has been implemented in eCommerce, and our efforts have turned out to be highly worthwhile. We end up with a novel and exciting visual search solution that is extremely easy to be deployed, distributed, scaled and monitored in a cost-friendly manner. Moreover, our platform is intrinsically flexible in supporting multimodal searches, where visual and textual information can be jointly leveraged in retrieval. The core idea is to encode image feature vectors into a collection of string tokens in a way such that closer vectors will share more string tokens in common. By doing that, we can utilize Elasticsearch to efficiently retrieve similar images based on similarities within encoded sting tokens. As part of the development, we propose a novel vector to string encoding method, which is shown to substantially outperform the previous ones in terms of both precision and latency. First-hand experiences in implementing this Elasticsearchbased platform are extensively addressed, which should be valuable to practitioners also interested in building visual search engine on top of Elasticsearch.

Systematic reviews, which statistically synthesize the entirety of the biomedical literature pertaining to a specific clinical question, are the cornerstone of EBM. These reviews are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious, and hence expensive. Producing a single review requires thousands of expert hours, spent culling relevant structured evidence from the vast unstructured evidence base (i.e., natural language articles describing the conduct and results of trials). The exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has exacerbated the situation: Health care practitioners can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care. The machine learning, natural language and information retrieval communities can lead the way in addressing this problem through the development of automation technologies that facilitate search and synthesis of evidence; but developing these will require meeting challenging technical problems. In this extended abstract, I discuss some of the progress made in recent years toward expediting unstructured biomedical evidence synthesis via automation techniques, and I highlight a few key challenges that remain.

It can provide distinctive guidance regarding previous working solutions for historical software management problems, or former success stories to be followed. However, the unstructured format of the LL repository makes it difficult to search using general queries, which are manually inputted by project managers (PMs). For this reason, this repository may often be overlooked despite the valuable information it provides. Since the LL repository targets PMs, the search method should be domain specific rather than generic as in the case of general web searching. In previous work, we provided an automatic information retrieval based LL classifier solution. In our solution, we relied on existing project management artifacts in constructing the search query on-the-fly. In this paper, we extend our previous work by examining the impact of the hybridization of multiple LL classifiers, from our previous study, on performance. We employ two of the hybridization techniques from the literature to construct the hybrid classifiers. An industrial dataset of 212 LL records is used for validation.

Continuous Active Learning (CAL) is a technique where a human reviewer works in loop with a machine learning model; the model presents a set of documents likely to be relevant and the reviewer provides relevance feedback. Our focus in this paper is on one particular aspect of CAL: refreshing, which is a crucial and recurring event in the CAL process. During a refresh, the machine learning model is trained with the relevance judgments and a new list of likely-to-be-relevant documents is produced for the reviewer to judge. It is also computationally the most expensive step in CAL. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the default and alternative refresh strategies on the effectiveness and efficiency of CAL. We find that more frequent refreshes can significantly reduce the human effort required to achieve certain recall. For moderately sized datasets, the high computation cost of frequent refreshes can be reduced through a careful implementation. For dealing with resource constraints and large datasets, we propose alternative refresh strategies which provide the benefits of frequent refreshes at a lower computation cost.

The development and evaluation of IR systems relies on the availability of suitable datasets or test collections. These typically consist of a target document collection, example search queries representative of those that users of the system to be developed, are expected to enter, and relevance data indicating which documents in the collection are relevant to the information needed as expressed in each query. Public research in IR has focused on popular content, e.g. news corpora or web content, for which average users can pose queries expressing information needs and judge the relevance of retrieved documents. This is not the case for professional search applications, for example legal, medical, financial search where domain experts are required for these tasks. We describe our experiences from the development of a professional legal IR application employing semantic search technologies. Our activities indicate the vital need for close interaction between the professionals for which the application is being developed and the IR researchers throughout the development life cycle of the search system. Such engagement is vital in order for the IR researchers to understand the working practices of the professional searchers, the specifications of their information needs and the domain in which they are searching, and to study how they engage and interact with information.

With the evolution of knowledge hierarchies, there is a need for measures to assess its temporal evolution, quantifying the similarities between different versions and identifying the relative growth of different subgraphs in the knowledge hierarchy. This work proposes a principled and scalable similarity measure, based on Katz similarity between concept nodes, for comparing knowledge hierarchies, modeled as generic Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). 1 Contribution Large knowledge repositories like DBpedia [6] represent concepts and relations as hierarchies expressing semantic connections via parent-child or hypernym-hyponym edges. These hierarchies (typically represented as DAGs) form the backbone of semantic search, personalization, recommendation and textual entailment, enabling easy navigation across concepts for information linking [1, 7, 4, 3] As the knowledge hierarchies evolve, there is a need for taxonomy evaluation, i.e., comparing hierarchies and quantifying their similarity. Intuitively, a principled similarity measure should demonstrate the following properties: (1) Sensitivity to Concept Hierarchy, (2) Proximity of Least Common Ancestor, and (3) Importance of Relationship. Additionally, the practicality of assessing large hierarchies imposes the factors of scalability, tunability, and interpretability for diverse applications. Automated Knowledge Hierarchy Assessment"}

When utilizing knowledge graphs and semantic annotations in information retrieval, two of the most useful features are the full text of the Wikipedia article and the textual context surrounding entity links [3, 6]. For a given free-text query, both Wiki-text and entity link contexts effectively support the retrieval of relevant entities; they constitute a rich source for query-specific expansion terms and entity-aware text relevance features. We are now adjusting this approach to better utilize WordNet for information retrieval. WordNet is a lexical database that has been curated manually over several decades according to psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory [7]. The major hurdle is that WordNet is a \"vertical\" resource, describing a taxonomic hierarchy of terms, where for information retrieval we also require \"horizontal\" information, i.e., access to other contextually related words for the same word sense. Currently, the only horizontal information available in WordNet are short glosses. Princeton's SemCor [8] constitutes an early attempt to link text tokens to the appropriate WordNet synsets. However, this resource is small and the annotated text is somewhat outdated. While manually selected synsets show improvements for retrieval [12], fully automated approaches either expand with all synsets or include expensive word sense disambiguation into the retrieval step [9]. Here we are investigating a third approach by building a \"horizontal\" resource: We apply word sense disambiguation [9] to large corpora and extract contexts surrounding disambiguated word senses. We construct WordNetContext, an auxiliary text resource to accompany WordNet, by associating each word sense with (1) the gloss and (2) all sense contexts. This new resource enables fast and efficient identification of the WordNet sense that is relevant to a keyword query, simply by indexing and retrieving from this resource. As a result, we obtain a reliable means for fully automated query expansion through disambiguated synonyms. We use this approach to cross-reference knowledge graphs with relevant WordNet senses. As depicted in Figure 1, these cross-references are based on the similarity between Wiki-text and entries in our WordNetContext resource. Finally, the WordNetContext resource text will be overlaid with annotations of WordNet's morphosyntactic, and semantic relations [4]. Since many queries, corpora, WordNet and Wikipedia are multilingual , we also envision various feedback mechanisms relevant for cross-language information retrieval. At its core, the new WordNetContext resource provides an ecosystem for the exchange of sense mappings and relations, including \"horizontal\" information about co-occurring terms, phrases, and Wikipedia entities. Therefore, we believe that the availability of WordNetContext will crucially increase the usefulness of the Word-Net resource for information retrieval and text understanding. To the best of our knowledge, previous works [5, 11, 1, 2] have not explored such a ressource for disambiguation and expansion in retrieval.

It is natural for dataset search queries to include quantities along with their units. Describing data in terms of units is an important characteristic when that data is to be used, even though such units are often not present in the data schema. However, quantity names are often provided with or without corresponding units in the column name or in an abbreviated format. Quantity names (e.g., length, weight and time) can be matched to a set of relevant units. Therefore, there is a significant need to automatically determine the quantity names for column values. We investigate the potential to recognize quantity names to which units belong. We assign each column a class label corresponding to the quantity name and thus configure the problem as a multi-class classification task, and then establish a variety of features based on the column name and column content.

In its basic formulation, the PP-Index is strongly biased toward efficiency, treating effectiveness as a secondary aspect. We show how the effectiveness can easily reach optimal levels just by adopting two \"boosting\" strategies: multiple index search and multiple query search. Such strategies have nice parallelization properties that allow to distribute the search process in order to keep high efficiency levels.

Users expectations are rarely considered to enhance the subjective relevance of returned results. However, exploiting such information can help search engines satisfy users by tailoring search results. Interestingly, user interests typically follow the clustering property: users who were interested in the same topics in the past are likely to be interested in these same topics also in the future. It follows that search results considered relevant by a user belonging to a group of homogeneous users will likely also be of interest to other users from the same group. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a novel peerto-peer system exploiting collaboratively built search mechanisms. The paper discusses the challenges associated with a system based on the interest clustering principle.

Current state-of-the-art approaches include the term-centric pruning approach and the document-centric pruning approach. While the term-centric pruning considers each inverted list independently and removes less important postings from each inverted list, the document-centric approach considers each document independently and removes less important terms from each document. In other words, the term-centric approach does not consider the relative importance of a posting in comparison with others in the same document, and the document-centric approach does not consider the relative importance of a posting in comparison with others in the same inverted list. The consequence is less important postings are not pruned in some situations, and important postings are pruned in some other situations. We propose a posting-based pruning approach, which is a generalization of both the term-centric and document-centric approaches. This approach ranks all postings and keeps only a subset of top ranked ones. The rank of a posting depends on several factors, such as its rank in its inverted list, its rank in its document, its weighting score, the term weight and the document weight.

In [5], the query terms associated with the domain of a URL were used as features for a URL classification task. The idea is that query terms that lead to successful classification of a URL are reliable semantic descriptors of the URL content. We follow up on this work by investigating which properties of a URL and its associated query terms predict the classification success. We construct a number of URL and query properties as predictors and proceed to analyze these in-depth. We conclude that the classification success-and thus the reliability of the query terms as URL descriptors-cannot easily be predicted from properties of the URL and the queries.

The framework leverages on the integration of conventional adaptive hypermedia techniques and ACT-R architecture which serves as the theoretical background for the cognitive model that monitors the interaction process between users and the system. The users' information seeking skills in the hyperspace specified by their viewing patterns within the web pages and access patterns between the web pages are extracted from user tracing data. The user's viewing patterns are discovered by analyzing their fixation sequences with eyePatterns. The user's navigation strategies in the hyperspace are evaluated in terms of information foraging theory to serve as their access patterns. Both of these patterns are transformed into the knowledge stored in the cognitive model. Based on these interaction experiences between the user and the system, the cognitive model will rearrange the presented information and the structure of the hyperspace in real time in order to facilitate the user to acquire valuable information as they perform information seeking tasks. Besides the flexible adaptability, this integration leads to the immediate feedback to assist the users' cognitive process to accomplish their information seeking tasks.

The position held here is that much of a user's search experience does not involve direct interaction with the interface, and may not be logged at all. Many models highlight the cognitive aspects of searching behaviour, and many consider that if a user does not like a user interface, then they do not interact with it very much.

In this paper, we apply a new paradigm we have proposed for measuring the impact of recognition errors on the stages of a standard text analysis pipeline: sentence boundary detection, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging. Our methodology formulates error classification as an optimization problem solvable using a hierarchical dynamic programming approach. Errors and their cascading effects are isolated and analyzed as they travel through the pipeline. We present experimental results based on a large collection of scanned pages to study the varying impact depending on the nature of the error and the character(s) involved. The problem of identifying tabular structures that should not be parsed as sentential text is also discussed. Optical character recognition errors and their effects on natural language processing"}

On realistic data, the break-even point for automatic correction so far could not be reached: the number of additional infelicitous corrections outnumbered the useful corrections. We present a new approach where we first compute a profile of the error channel for the given text. During the correction process, the profile helps to restrict attention to a small set of \"suspicious\" lexical tokens of the input text where it is \"plausible\" to assume that the token represents a false friend. Using a conventional word trigram statistics for disambiguation we obtain a correction method that can be successfully applied to unrestricted text. In experiments for OCR documents, we show significant accuracy gains by fully automatic correction of false friends. Successfully detecting and correcting false friends using channel profiles"}

In many domains, the same entity could be referred to in multiple ways due to variations introduced by different user groups, variations of spellings across regions or cultures, usage of abbreviations, typographical errors and other reasons associated with conventional usage. Identifying a piece of text as a mention of an entity in such noisy data is difficult, even if we have a dictionary of possible entities. Previous approaches treat the synonym problem as part entity disambiguation and use learning-based methods that use the context of the words to identify synonyms. In this paper, we show that existing domain knowledge, encoded as rules, can be used effectively to address the synonym problem to a considerable extent. This makes the disambiguation task simpler, without the need for much training data. We look at a subset of application scenarios in named entity extraction, categorize the possible variations in entity names, and define rules for each category. Using these rules, we generate synonyms for the canonical list and match these synonyms to the actual occurrence in the data sets. In particular, we describe the rule categories that we developed for several named entities and report the results of applying our technique of extracting named entities by generating synonyms for two different domains.

We introduce a method to explicitly incorporate a model of topical noise into a language modeling approach to the task of blog distillation. Topical noise is integrated into the model using a coherence score, which reflects the tightness of the topical structure of a blog. Tests performed on the TRECBlog06 corpus show that a naive integration of the coherence score as blog prior fails to achieve performance improvements. Instead, we develop a set of more sophisticated models in which the coherence score is weighted by a function of the blog retrieval score. The proposed models help improve effectiveness of our language modeling approach to the blog distillation task. Blogger, stick to your story: modeling topical noise in blogs with coherence measures"}

While this makes them more natural -noisy and unstructured -it provides an unrivalled opportunity to see \"inside\" the author, to collect some context. The data requires analysis methods that have a relationship to human information processing: socio-cognitively motivated semantic systems. Using HAL, a method validated by cognitive science, the text from a large number of blog entries was analysed to uncover changes in entries author's sense-of-self. Sense-of-self was measured through geometric projection of author's first-person usage onto key indicators of kin and negative emotion words. An example of non-clinical qualitative evaluation affirmed the utility and promise of the technique: that deep personal context can be uncovered from utterances through the appropriate analysis and inference.

One example task is to find the most relevant topical blogs against a given query or an existing blog. Such a task requires concise representation of blogs for effective and efficient searching and matching. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of profiling a blog by choosing a set of m most representative entries from the blog, where m is a predefined number that is application-dependent. With the set of selected representative entries, applications on blogs avoid handling hundreds or even thousands of entries (or posts) associated with each blog, which are updated frequently and often noisy in nature. To guide the process of selecting the most representative entries, we propose three principles, i.e., anomaly, representativeness, and diversity. Based on these principles, a greedy yet very efficient entry selection algorithm is proposed. To evaluate the entry selection algorithms, an extrinsic evaluation methodology from document summarization research is adapted. Specifically, we evaluate the proposed entry selection algorithms by examining their blog classification accuracies. By evaluating on a number of different classification methods, our empirical results showed that comparable classification accuracy could be achieved by using fewer than 20 representative entries for each blog compared to that of engaging all entries.

Spam Blogs or Splogs comprise the subset of blogs, which are usually written to target specific audience for marketing promotions and are mostly generated by software that readily imitates Zipfian distribution of words. Therefore it becomes a difficult task to separate splogs from non-splogs using only frequentist distribution of unigrams.

Such corruptions are very common in instant messenger (IM) and short message service (SMS) data and adversely affect off the shelf text mining methods. Most techniques address this problem by supervised methods. But they require labels that are very expensive and time consuming to obtain. While we do not champion unsupervised methods over supervised when quality of results is the supreme and singular concern, we demonstrate that unsupervised methods can provide cost effective results without the need for expensive human intervention to generate parallely labelled corpora. A generative model based unsupervised technique is presented that maps non-standard words to their corresponding conventional frequent form. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) over subsequencized representation of words is used subject to a parameterization such that the training phase involves clustering over vectors and not the customary dynamic programming over sequences. A principled transformation of maximum likelihood based \"central clustering\" cost function into a \"pairwise similarity\" based clustering is proposed. This transformation makes it possible to apply \"subsequence kernel\" based methods that model delete and insert edit operations well. The novelty of this approach lies in that the expensive (Baum-Welch) iterations required for HMM, can be avoided through a careful factorization of the HMM Loglikelihood and in establishing the connection between information theoretic cost function and the kernel approach of machine learning.

This kind of vocabulary is often out-of-vocabulary (OOV) for dictionaries that are used to translate queries. In historic document retrieval (HDR), OCR errors and historical spelling variants cause similar problems. In this paper, three data driven approaches to these problems are presented. The two first methods, the transformation rule based translation (TRT) method and the classified s-gram method, operate on string level. With them approximate matches of a query word can be recognized from the target document collection and included into the target query. In the third method, the corpus-based approach, parallel or comparable corpora are employed to derive translation knowledge that can be used to translate OOV words. Besides the overview of the methods, three case studies highlighting their practical applications in CLIR are also presented. The methods are shown to be effective in query translation without dictionaries between closely related languages (TRT and s-grams), OOV word translation (s-grams), and boosting dictionary-based CLIR performance by way of OOV word translation (corpus based methods).

Text analytics has matured and is being successfully employed to mine important information from unstructured text documents. Most of these techniques use Natural Language Processing techniques which assume that the underlying text is clean and correct. Statistical techniques, though not as accurate as linguistic mechanisms, are also employed for the purpose to overcome the dependence on clean text. The chief bottleneck for designing statistical mechanisms is however its dependence on appropriately annotated training data. None of these methodologies are suitable for mining information from online communication text data due to the fact that they are often noisy. These texts are informally written. They suffer from spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, improper punctuation and irrational capitalization. This paper focuses on opinion extraction from noisy text data. It is aimed at extracting and consolidating opinions of customers from blogs and feedbacks, at multiple levels of granularity. Ours is a hybrid approach, in which we initially employ a semi-supervised method to learn domain knowledge from a training repository which contains both noisy and clean text. Thereafter we employ localized linguistic techniques to extract opinion expressions from noisy text. We have developed a system based on this approach, which provides the user with a platform to analyze opinion expressions extracted from a repository. Opinion mining from noisy text data"}

Previous research in this area has shown that word recognizers produce reasonably clean output when used with a restricted lexicon. But in absence of such a restricted lexicon, the output of an unconstrained handwritten word recognizer is noisy. The objective of this research is to process noisy recognizer output and eliminate spurious recognition choices using a topic based language model. We construct a topic based language model for every document using a training data which is manually categorized. A topic categorization sub-system based on Maximum Entropy model is also trained which is used to generate the topic distribution of a test document. A given test word image is processed by the recognizer and its word recognition likelihood is refined by incorporating topic distribution of the document and topic based language model probability. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available IAM dataset and experimental results show significant improvement in the word recognition accuracy from 32% to 40% over a test set consisting of 4033 word images extracted from 70 handwritten document images.

Tokenization is a languagedependent approach, including normalization, stop words removal, lemmatization and stemming. Both stemming and lemmatization share a common goal of reducing a word to its base. However, lemmatization is more robust than stemming as it often involves usage of vocabulary and morphological analysis, as opposed to simply removing the suffix of the word. In this work, we introduce a novel lemmatization algorithm for the Arabic Language. The new lemmatizer proposed here is a part of a comprehensive Arabic tokenization system, with a stop words list exceeding 2200 Arabic words. Currently, there are two Arabic leading stemmers: the root-based stemmer and the light stemmer. We hypothesize that lemmatization would be more effective than stemming in mining Arabic text. We investigate the impact of our new lemmatizer on unsupervised data mining techniques in comparison to the leading Arabic stemmers. We conclude that lemmatization is a better word normalization method than stemming for Arabic text. A novel Arabic lemmatization algorithm"}

In distributed information retrieval systems, document overlaps occur frequently across results from different resources. This is especially the case for meta-search engines which merge results from several web search engines. This paper addresses the problem of merging results exploiting overlaps in order to achieve better performance. New algorithms for merging results are proposed, which take advantage of the use of duplicate documents in two ways: one correlates scores from different results; the other regards duplicates as increasing evidence of being relevant to the given query. An extensive experimentation has demonstrated that these methods are effective. New Methods of Results Merging for Distributed Information Retrieval"}

Computer-based systems may help to detect near-duplicate music documents and plagiarisms. The main part of the existing systems for the comparison of symbolic music are based on string matching algorithms and represent music as sequences of notes. Nevertheless, adaptation to the musical context raises specific problems and a direct adaptation does not lead to an accurate detection algorithm: indeed, very different sequences can represent very similar musical pieces. We are developing an improved system which mainly considers melody but takes also into account elements of music theory in order to detect musically important differences between sequences. In this paper, we present the improvements proposed by our system in the context of the near-duplicate music document detection. Several experiments with famous music copyright infringement cases are proposed. In both monophonic and polyphonic context, the system allows the detection of plagiarisms.

Existing research to intrinsic plagiarism analysis tries to quantify changes in the writing style by analyzing the distributions of particular style markers. This way, acceptable detection rates can be achieved if the portion of plagiarized sections is known a-priori and if the document is of a single genre. However, both assumptions may not be fulfilled in practice. In [6] Koppel and Schler propose a new approach to the authorship verification problem, where the task is to determine whether two texts are written by the same author. Their approach is ingenious in that it provides a means to detect relatively shallow differences in writing style while being independent of language, period, and genre. Since the approach requires two (relatively large) samples of text to be compared to each other it cannot be applied directly to the intrinsic plagiarism analysis problem. Main contribution of our paper is the idea to address the shortcomings of existing approaches to intrinsic plagiarism analysis with the technology presented in [6]. We propose a hybrid approach that employs style marker analysis for the purpose of hypotheses generation which then are accepted or rejected by an authorship verification analysis. A second contribution of our paper is the evaluation of style markers for German text and their application to a real-world plagiarism case. Intrinsic Plagiarism Analysis with Meta Learning"}

Very often, there are extremely few training texts at least for some of the candidate authors or there is a significant variation in the text-length among the available training texts of the candidate authors. Moreover, in this task usually there is no similarity between the distribution of training and test texts over the classes, that is, a basic assumption of inductive learning does not apply. Previous work [3] provided solutions to this problem for instance-based author identification approaches (i.e., each training text is considered a separate training instance). This work [4] deals with the class imbalance problem in profile-based author identification approaches (i.e., a profile is extracted from all the training texts per author). In particular, a variation of the Common N-Grams (CNG) method, a language-independent profile-based approach [2] with good results in many author identification experiments so far [1], is presented based on new distance measures that are quite stable for large profile length values. Special emphasis is given to the degree upon which the effectiveness of the method is affected by the available training text samples per author. Experiments based on text samples on the same topic from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 are presented using both balanced and imbalanced training corpora. The results show that CNG with the proposed distance measures is more accurate when only limited training text samples are available, at least for some of the candidate authors, a realistic condition in author identification problems.

This bias creates the wisdom of ad hoc crowds or the wisdom of a few. Although it is well known that user activity in most settings follows a power law, that is, few people do a lot, while most do nothing, there are few studies that characterize well this activity. In a recent analysis of social network data we corroborated that a small percentage of the active users (passive users are the majority) represent at least the 50% of the UGC. As a sub-product, we also found a lower bound for the digital desert, the content in the Web that nobody reads.

For example, our ability to accurately interpret the intent of a web search can be informed by knowledge of the web pages a searcher was viewing when initiating the search or recent actions of the searcher such as queries issued, results clicked, and pages viewed. In this talk, I will describe a recent framework for personalized search which improves the quality of search results by enabling a representation of a broad variety of context including the searcher's long-term interests, recent activity, current focus, and other user characteristics. Then, I will review a variety of related work that extends these approaches from signals focused on the individual to social signals such as likes, cohorts, and affiliation networks.

We focus on selecting appropriate suggestions from the ClueWeb12 collection using tourist domain knowledge inferred from social sites and resources available on the public Web (Open Web). Specifically, we generate two candidate subsets retrieved from the ClueWeb12 collection, one by filtering the content on mentions of the location context, and one by integrating domain knowledge derived from the Open Web. The impact of these candidate selection methods on contextual suggestion effectiveness is analyzed using the test collection constructed for the TREC Contextual Suggestion Track in 2014.

Nevertheless, Web users do not restrict themselves to posting their questions exclusively in these platforms. With the massification of on-line social networks (OSN) such as Twitter, users are increasingly sharing their information needs on these websites. Their motivation for doing so is to obtain a timely and reliable answer from their personal community of trusted contacts. Therefore, daily on Twitter, there are hundreds of thousands of questions being shared among users from all over the world. Many of these questions go unanswered, but also an important number receive relevant and complete replies from the network. The problem is that due to the volatile nature of the streaming data in OSN and the high arrival rates of messages, valuable knowledge shared in this Q&A interaction lives very shortly in time. This produces high redundancy and similarity in questions which occurs consistently over time. Following this motivation we study Q&A conversations on Twitter, with the goal of finding the most relevant conversations posted in the past that answer new information needs posted by users. To achieve this we create a collection of Q&A conversation threads and analyze their relevance for a query, based on their contents and relevance feedback from users. In this article, we present our work in progress which includes a methodology for retrieving and ranking Q&A conversation threads for a given query. Our preliminary findings show that we are able to use historical conversation on Twitter to answer new queries posted by users. We observe that in general the asker's feedback is a good indicator of thread relevance. Also, not all of the feedback features provided by Twitter are equally useful for ranking Q&A thread relevance. Our current work focuses on determining empirically the best ranking strategy for the recommendation of relevant threads for a new user question. In the future we seek to create an automatic Q&A knowledge base that is updated in real-time that allows for preserving and searching human understanding.

This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and \"Graph Search\" offers major new ways to access relevant information. Graph search affects both query formulation (complex queries about entities and relations building on the searcher's context) as well as result exploration and discovery (slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure) in a completely personalized way. This new graph based approach introduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, in terms of data quality and data integration, user interface design, and privacy. We view the notion of \"graph search\" as searching information from your personal point of view (you are the query) over a highly structured and curated information space. This goes beyond the traditional two-term queries and ten blue links results that users are familiar with, requiring a highly interactive session covering both query formulation and result exploration.

They eventually miss out on important information, need significantly more time for searching than high search literate users, and overestimate their skills in the domain of web search. In this paper, we introduce the ongoing WebSAIL project (Web Search literacy, Awareness, Interface complexity, and Longterm e\u21b5ects) that tackles these problems. The prime aim is to enhance web search literacy (WSL) by teaching search strategies and basic and advanced concepts of web search engines in the form of a task based application. Users will be introduced to more complex search interfaces (containing more than a single query box) as in some cases these would lead to better results but are hardly used due to the lack of motivation. Furthermore, WebSAIL focuses on long-lasting enhancements: acquired abilities should be sustainable instead of a temporary nature only. The present project follows two approaches for enhancing WSL: online-tutorials and gamification. After evaluating each method on its own, we will compare the results to answer 1) whether WSL could be enhanced and 2) which approach suited best our goals. Moreover, by evaluating same subjects after a certain period, we 3) will be capable of noticing whether acquired skills remained sustainable. Gamification for WebSAIL"}

This is for instance the case in corporate environments where some words are used with special meanings that can be obscure to other people. This paper presents the prototype of a gamified application that aims at improving translations of and for online meetings. In our system, users play to earn points and rewards-and they try to propose and vote for the most accurate translations in context. Our system uses various techniques to split conversations in various semantically coherent segments and label them with relevant keyphrases. This is how we extract a description of the context of a sentence and we use this context to: (i) weight users' expertise and their translation (e.g., an AI specialist is more likely than a lay person to give a correct translation for a sentence about deep learning) (ii) map the various translations of words and phrases and their context, so that we can use them during online meetings.

Instead, we propose a novel alternate approach to improve motivation for exergaming, which we call fitnessification: integrating physical exercise into very popular games that have been developed keeping fun in mind and frequently are played for long periods of time-so-called AAA games. In order to evaluate this concept, we have conducted a comparative study examining voluntary participants' reactions to testing an ergometer controlled casual game as well as a modified AAA game.

However, there still lacks a fine-grained understanding of users' knowledge change patterns within a search process and users' adoption of different sources for learning. In this ongoing project, we are exploring answers to both questions in collaborative information seeking (CIS) since the CIS tasks are usually exploratory, which triggers learning, and involve diverse learning resources such as self-explored search content, partners' search content and explicit communication between them. Through analyzing the data from a controlled laboratory user study with both collaborative and individual information seeking conditions, we demonstrated that users' knowledge keeps growing in both conditions, but they issue significantly more diverse queries in the collaborative condition. Our analysis of users' queries also revealed that the adoption of different learning resources varies at different information seeking stages, and the adoption is influenced by the nature of search tasks too.

Simulations on six difficult information search tasks and subsequent matching with actual behavioural data from 48 users (divided into low and high domain knowledge groups based on a domain knowledge test) were conducted. Results showed that the efficacy of modeling user selections on search results (in terms of the number of matches between users and the model and the mean semantic similarity values of the matched search results) is higher with the special semantic space compared to the general semantic space for high domain knowledge participants while for low domain knowledge participants it is the other way around.

A strong disparity exists between the language distribution of Web content and the representation of speakers of different languages among Web users. The proportion of Web content available in English is much larger than the proportion of native-English-speaking Web users. This disparity often forces non-native speakers of English to search for information in English. In this process they do not only learn the language, but also familiarize themselves with a new culture and information landscape.

In fact, learning-related tasks represent a significant fraction of the time users spend using Web search, so methods for evaluating and optimizing search engines to maximize learning are likely to have broad impact. Thus, we introduce and evaluate a retrieval algorithm designed to maximize educational utility for a vocabulary learning task, in which users learn a set of important keywords for a given topic by reading representative documents on diverse aspects of the topic. Using a crowdsourced pilot study, we compare the learning outcomes of users across four conditions corresponding to rankings that optimize for di\u21b5erent levels of keyword density. We find that adding keyword density to the retrieval objective gave significant learning gains on some topics, with higher levels of keyword density generally corresponding to more time spent reading per word, and stronger learning gains per word read. We conclude that our approach to optimizing search ranking for educational utility leads to retrieved document sets that ultimately may result in more e cient learning of important concepts.

If we knew the answer, then a search system may be able to help users learn about their current search processes, which in turn may enable them to make the whole search process more efficient, leading to greater effectiveness and user satisfaction. This paper is a first step towards solving this problem. Using a previously collected data set, we identified the point of success and hence task completion, and investigated the search behaviour before and after users had accessed all relevant documents for answering assigned tasks. We used a set of search behaviour actions derived from Marchionini's (1995) Information Seeking Process model, and modeled the distribution of these actions throughout the entire search process, comparing actions before and after success could have been attained. Our results suggest that six defined actions, namely user-submitted query, system-suggested query, forward to items, evaluate relevant items, reflect, and answer appeared to change according to the stage of the entire search process. Also, users have notably distinct patterns before and after search success was obtained, but not realised by the user. Not all action were affected; user-submitted query and system-suggested query appeared to be unaffected by time in post-success case and presuccess case, respectively.

Three types of allocation policies (random, source-based and topic-based) are studied. Kmeans clustering is used to create topic-based shards. We manage the computational cost of applying these techniques to large datasets by defining topics on a subset of the collection.

The adoption of these proximity weighting models can cause a computational overhead when documents are scored, negatively impacting the efficiency of the retrieval process. In this paper, we discuss the integration of proximity weighting models into efficient dynamic pruning strategies. In particular, we propose to modify document-at-a-time strategies to include proximity scoring without any modifications to pre-existing index structures. Our resulting two-stage dynamic pruning strategies only consider single query terms during first stage pruning, but can early terminate the proximity scoring of a document if it can be shown that it will never be retrieved. We empirically examine the efficiency benefits of our approach using a large Web test collection of 50 million documents and 10,000 queries from a real query log.

In order to get the performance we are used to, Web search engines are based on large-scale distributed systems and to optimise its performance is an important aspect in the literature. The main methods, that can be found in the literature, to analyse the performance of a distributed IR system are: the use of an analytical model, a simulation model and a real search engine. When using an analytical or simulation model some details could be missing and this will produce some differences between the real and estimated performance. When using a real system, the results obtained will be more precise but the resources required to build a large-scale search engine are excessive. In this paper we propose to study the performance by building a scaled-down version of a search engine using virtualization tools to create a realistic distributed system. Scaling-down a distributed IR system will maintain the behaviour of the whole system and, at the same time, the computer requirements will be softened. This allows the use of virtualization tools to build a large-scale distributed system using just a small cluster of computers.

E-commerce vendors frequently sell the same items but use different marketing strategies to present their goods. Understanding consumer responses to this heterogeneous landscape of information is important both as business intelligence and, more broadly, a window into consumer attitudes. When studying consumer behavior, the existing literature is primarily concerned with product reviews. In this paper we posit that textual product descriptions are also important determinants of consumer choice. We mine 90,000+ product descriptions on the Japanese e-commerce marketplace Rakuten and identify actionable writing styles and word usages that are highly predictive of consumer purchasing behavior. In the process, we observe the inadequacies of traditional feature extraction algorithms, namely their inability to control for the implicit effects of confounds like brand loyalty and pricing strategies. To circumvent this problem, we propose a novel neural network architecture that leverages an adversarial objective to control for confounding factors, and attentional scores over its input to automatically elicit textual features as a domain-specific lexicon. We show that these textual features can predict the sales of each product, and investigate the narratives highlighted by these words. Our results suggest that appeals to authority, polite language, and mentions of informative and seasonal language win over the most customers.

Therefore, retrieving more relevant items by performing more aggressive query rewrites will largely improve the user experience. This paper proposes a query rewrite system that reformulate the original query into multiple alternative queries that enlarge recall without altering the main search intent. In this paper, we present a term dropping algorithm that understands and keeps the important terms in the query, and a term replacement algorithm that learns from user behavior and language model. Experiments on randomly sampled eBay queries shows that the n-best rewrites by these two algorithms effectively recover more relevant items.

Users issue queries, and the results to those queries are likely to be the same from day to day so can be cached. eCommerce, on the other hand, is quite different.

We hypothesize that search and retrieval based techniques are sub-optimal for learning complex relation likes provenance. State-of-the-art information retrieval techniques using term frequency-inverted document frequency (TF-IDF) to capture surface level closeness along with different textual similarity features for semantic closeness are insufficient to capture implied and entailed provenance with less surface-level similarity. In our comparative studies, we find that the provenance is relative i.e. something makes a better provenance than other based on certain linguistic cue or key information being more prominently conveyed, and hence we model the problem as pairwiseranking and not simple ranking or classification. To capture above points we propose a joint scoring approach weighting surface level closeness and learned semantic relation. We use TF-IDF and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for the syntactic score and pairwise neural network ranking model to calculate semantic relatedness score.

The entity label is submitted as a search query to a general search engine and the top ranked documents are used to add context to the ranking process. The ranking model identifies and ranks the most important attributes (facts) of an entity. In order to experiment with our approach, we initially collected a dataset by exploiting Wikipedia infoboxes, whose ordering of attributes reflects the collaborative effort of a large community of Wikipedia users.

Our method encodes logical rules about entities and relations as convex constraints in the embedding space to enforce the condition that the score of a logically entailed fact must never be less than the minimum score of an antecedent fact.

This is due to the short text length of the abstracts. Also, abstracts are a general discussion of the topic with few domain specific terms. These reasons make it hard to generate good representations of abstracts which in turn leads to poor categorization performance. To address this challenge, external Knowledge Bases (KB) like Wikipedia, Freebase etc. can be used to enrich the representations for abstracts, which can aid in the categorization task. In this work, we propose a novel method for enhancing classification performance of research papers into ACM computer science categories using knowledge extracted from related Wikipedia articles and Freebase entities. We use state-of-the-art representation learning methods for feature representation of documents, followed by learning to rank method for classification. Given the abstracts of research papers from the Citation Network Dataset containing 0.24M papers, our method of using KB, outperforms a baseline method and the stateof-the-art deep learning method in classification task by 13.25% and 5.41% respectively, in terms of accuracy.

Finding the right relation a natural question asks is a key step in current knowledge based question answering systems, while also being the most difficult one, because of the mismatch between natural language question and formal relation type definitions. In this paper, we present two approaches to tackle this problem. The first approach tries to directly learn the soft match between the question and the relations from the training data using neural networks. The second approach enriches the relation name with natural language support sentences generated from Wikipedia, which provide additional matches with the question. Experiments on the WebQuestions dataset demonstrate that both of our approaches improve the relation matching accuracy of a prior state-of-the-art. Our further analysis reveals the high quality of support sentences and suggests the rich potential of support sentences in question answering and semantic parsing tasks.

Answering E-R queries requires gathering and joining evidence from multiple unstructured documents. In this work, we consider entity and relationships of any type, i.e, characterized by context terms instead of pre-defined types or relationships. We propose a novel IR-centric approach for E-R retrieval, that builds on the basic early fusion design pattern for object retrieval, to provide extensible entity-relationship representations, suitable for complex, multi-relationships queries. We performed experiments with Wikipedia articles as entity representations combined with relationships extracted from ClueWeb-09-B with FACC1 entity linking. We obtained promising results using 3 different query collections comprising 469 E-R queries. Recent work in E-R search followed a Semantic-Web-based approach by extending SPARQL and creating an extended knowledge graph [3]. However, it is not always convenient to rely on a structured knowledge graph with pre-defined and constraining entity types. For instance, search over transient information sources, such as social media [4] or online news [5], require more flexible approaches. Early Fusion Strategy for Entity-Relationship Retrieval"}

Digital libraries commonly provide advanced search interfaces, through which researchers can find and explore the most related scientific studies. Even though the publications of a single author can be easily retrieved and explored, understanding how authors have collaborated with each other on specific research topics and to what extent their collaboration have been fruitful is, in general, a challenging task. This paper proposes a new pattern-based approach to analyzing the correlations among the authors of most influential research studies. To this purpose, it analyzes publication data retrieved from digital libraries and online databases by means of an itemset-based data mining algorithm. It automatically extracts patterns representing the most relevant collaborations among authors on specific research topics. Patterns are evaluated and ranked according to the number of citations received by the corresponding publications. The proposed approach was validated in a real case study, i.e., the analysis of scientific literature on genomics. Specifically, we first analyzed scientific studies on genomics acquired from the OMIM database to discover correlations between authors and genes or genetic disorders. Then, the reliability of the discovered patterns was assessed using the PubMed search engine. The results show that, for the majority of the mined patterns, the most influential (top ranked) studies retrieved by performing author-driven PubMed queries range over the same gene/genetic disorder indicated by the top ranked pattern.

Next, we present a method to address the former type of task. Our system consists of two steps: sentence ranking and sentence selection. In the sentence ranking step, the system ranks sentences in the input papers by regarding aspects as queries. We use LexRank and also incorporate query expansion and word embedding to compensate for tersely expressed queries. In the sentence selection step, the system selects sentences that remain in the final output. Specifically emphasizing the summarization type aspects, we regard this step as an integer linear programming problem with a special type of constraint imposed to make summaries comparable. We evaluated our system using a dataset we created from the ACL Anthology. The results of manual evaluation demonstrated that our selection method using comparability improved performance.

Instead, patent trolls sue other companies that allegedly violate their obvious patents. We propose a method that challenges patent trolls by generating large amounts of obvious patent abstracts automatically. In contrast to prior art, our approach generates abstracts for any patent category and achieves high diversity in content and structure of the resulting abstracts. Furthermore, we timestamp the generated abstracts using a decentralized timestamping service so that users can prove that a generated abstract existed at a certain point in time.

This talk reflects well my research area, which uniquely connects Information Retrieval (IR), Information Science (IS), and Data Science (DS). My research area is attributed to my educational and working background: I obtained my Master's degree in Software Engineering and my Ph.D. degree in Information Science. Now I am a faculty member at a computing department. Historically, there has been a divide between systems and users in the IR research communities. I believe this divide reflects how researchers weigh the relative importance between developing new retrieval algorithms compared to understanding how people search for information. However, there is increasing agreement that the interaction between the users and the search engine is a fundamental part of the IR process. Due to my unique background, I am the researcher who builds models, develops algorithms, as well as runs user studies in order to understand how people seek information. My research has provided evidence that more effective information access can be achieved by a system that actively supports user interaction. IR researchers make modern search engines or recommender systems rank better, retrieve better, or just function better, and most of today's IR papers are very well-defined or in other words, narrowly focused. I believe this BIRDS workshop is eye-widening, and will provide thoughts from a bigger, richer, or more comprehensive view of how information retrieval systems can better serve people, not only for their short-term needs but also for their long-term benefits, not only for the immediate relevance, but also for broader discovery. Our research project on faceted search is an example of how IR, IS, and DS complement each other, offering a holistic approach that goes beyond each discipline alone. Faceted search has become a common feature on most search interfaces in e-commerce websites, digital libraries, government's open information portals, and so on.

As an important developing research field, user-centred information search system design should benefit from the theories and approaches of affective design. It is especially beneficial to the interactive health information search, where the search tasks can give users negative emotions. This paper explores the impact of affective design on health information search behaviours in terms of online interaction, query formulation and result selection through an eye-tracking user study. Eye-tracking experiment results show that affective design has a positive impact on the user's information search behaviour. For example, the users tend to form more precise search query formulation, spend more time on the search, and explore and find more relevant results for the task, and they interact more with the affective design features on the search interface.

Especially, the HTML contents contain valuable information about the individual health condition and graph knowledge presents the semantics of words in the contents. This paper focuses on combining these two for extracting causality knowledge. Understanding causality relations is one of the crucial tasks to support building an Artificial Intelligent (AI) enabled healthcare system. Unlike other raw data sources used by AI processes, the causality semantic dataset is generated in this paper, which is believed to be more efficient and transparent for supporting AI tasks. Currently, neural network-based deep learning processes found themselves in a hard position to explain the prediction outputs, which is majorly because of lacking knowledge-based probability analysis. Dynamic probability analysis based on causality modeling is a new research area that not only can model the knowledge in a machine-understandable way but also can create causal probability relations inside the knowledge. To achieve this, a causal probability generation framework is proposed in this paper that extends the current Description Logic (DL), applies semantic Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach, and calculates runtime causal probabilities according to the given input conditions. The framework can be easily implemented using existing programming standards. The experimental evaluations extract 383 common disease conditions from the UK NHS (the National Health Service) and enable automatically linked 418 condition terms from the DBpedia dataset.

Unfortunately, bias affects automated decision systems and as a consequence fairness cannot be taken for granted. Understanding whether and how bias affects search results can be a necessary and useful condition to every user and designer who aims to investigate the reasons that the systems fail or succeed. In this paper, we discuss whether Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) can be a useful methodology to investigate the causal relationships between the variables describing the content representation and retrieval processes of search engines and recommender systems. Understanding how and why a retrieval system retrieves certain documents can help understand when the system provides biased results. To this end, we provide a general illustration of the issues and the potential of SEM for causal discovery in Information Retrieval.

Meanwhile, expert searchers are found to spend large amounts of time carefully creating manual CNF queries. These CNF queries are highly effective, and can outperform bag of word queries by a large margin. However, not many effective tools exist that can facilitate the efficient manual creation of effective CNF queries. We describe such a publicly available search tool, WikiQuery, which can efficiently assist the users to create CNF queries through easy query editing and immediate access to search results. Experiments show that ordinary search users, with limited prior knowledge of Boolean queries, can use this intuitive tool to create effective CNF queries. We argue that tools like WikiQuery can attract and retain certain users from the commercial Web search engines, and may be a good starting point to build a research Web search engine.

Brown', 'Savitha Srinivasan'] SIGIR 2001.sigirconf_workshop-2001w1.0 1557820840.0 Interest in speech applications dates back a number of decades. However, it is only in the last few years that automatic speech recognition has left the confines of the basic research lab and become a viable commercial application. Speech recognition technology has now matured to the point where speech can be used to interact with automated phone systems, control computer programs, and even create memos and documents. Moving beyond computer control and dictation, speech recognition has the potential to dramatically change the way we create, capture, and store knowledge. Advances in speech recognition technology combined with ever decreasing storage costs and processors that double in power every eighteen months have set the stage for a whole new era of applications that treat speech in the same way that we currently treat text.The goal of this workshop was to explore the technical issues involved in applying information retrieval and text analysis technologies in the new application domains enabled by automatic speech recognition. These possibilities bring with them a number of issues, questions, and problems. Speech-based user interfaces create different expectations for the end user, which in turn places different demands on the back-end systems that must interact with the user and interpret the user's commands. Speech recognition will never be perfect, so analyses applied to the resulting transcripts must be robust in the face of recognition errors. The ability to capture speech and apply speech recognition on smaller, more powerful, pervasive devices suggests that text analysis and mining technologies can be applied in new domains never before considered.This workshop explored techniques in information retrieval and text analysis that meet the challenges in the new application domains enabled by automatic speech recognition. We posed seven questions to the contributors to focus on:1. What new IR related applications, problems, or opportunities are created by effective, real-time speech recognition? 2. To what extent are information retrieval methods that work on perfect text applicable to imperfect speech transcripts? 3. What additional data representations from a speech engine may be exploited by applications? 4. Does domain knowledge (context/voice-id) help and can it be automatically deduced? 5. Can some of the techniques explored be beneficial in a standard IR application? 6. What constraints are imposed by real time speech applications? 7. Case studies of specific speech applications -either successful or not.\nVI PrefaceThe contributions covered a wide spectrum of topics. We have grouped them into a few main categories, introduced below.\nTraditional Information Retrieval TechniquesThe paper by James Allan reviews the effects of speech transcription errors on traditional information retrieval tasks and shows that these effects are minimal. Allan points out that the tasks studied are based on the traditional information retrieval framework. In particular, the queries are longer than those seen in web or emerging speech applications. Furthermore, the evaluation is based on returning documents instead of paragraphs, sentences, or answers, and Allan speculates on how a different framework might change the results.\nSpoken Document Pre-processingThe first area to consider is the collection itself that traditionally contained only textual documents. However, multimedia collections are becoming more prominent and one of the media is speech. Collections may contain actual speech recordings or transcripts of speech recordings and this new mixed environment poses new challenges.Speech recordings are either translated into text (i.e., the transcript), or application tasks are performed directly on the recordings. Examining the transcripts, they are in general not perfect and tools have been developed which improve the quality of transcript. An example of a novel tool is the automatic capitalization of mono-case text. This is an important task as closed caption text, for instance, is mono-case. Furthermore, automatically generated transcripts could have the wrong capitalization and it could prove important that capitalization be uniform. Brown and Coden present a discussion of these issues and several algorithms in the paper \"Capitalization Recovery for Text.\"\nAdapting IR Techniques to Spoken DocumentsMany known information retrieval tasks traditionally operate on well edited and grammatically correct text. It is an area of research to explore how these tasks operate on speech transcripts. An alternate approach is to execute the same IR tasks directly on speech recordings and compare the results both in terms of effectiveness and performance. The paper \"Clustering of Imperfect Transcripts using a Novel Similarity Measure\" by Ibrahimov, Sethi, and Dimitrova discusses a traditional IR task (clustering) on a novel domain of data (speech transcripts). D\u00e9silets, de Bruijn, and Martin explore another traditional IR task -keyphrase extraction -on this novel domain in the paper \"Extracting Keyphrases from Spoken Audio Documents.\" A traditional IR task is to segment text and the paper \"Segmenting Conversations by Topic, Initiative, and Style\" by Ries explores speech features for the segmentation process. The paper \"Extracting Caller Information from Voicemail\" by Huang, Zweig, and Padmanabhan describes a Preface VII traditional IR task (extracting information) in a spoken word environment. The information needed is very specific to this environment, for instance, extracting all names or all numbers would not satisfy the goal of the application.\nTechniques for Multi-media CollectionsTo date, most tasks are performed either on a purely textual collection or solely on speech recordings or their transcripts. Tasks applied to mixed collections seem to favor textual data, which may not always be appropriate. The paper \"Speech and Hand Transcribed Retrieval\" by Sanderson and Shou explores this area. In particular, it explores whether one could apply traditional IR techniques with varying parameters to address the different types of data in the collection.\nNew ApplicationsSo far, we have focused on traditional information retrieval tasks where the data on which these tasks are performed is speech. However, with a new domain, new tasks can be exploited. First, we must investigate whether users have different expectations when performing tasks on speech. The paper by Kim and Oard entitled \"The Use of Speech Retrieval Systems: A Study Design,\" proposes a user study whose goal is to determine the user expectation in this emerging field.The paper \"Speech-Driven Text Retrieval: Using Target IR Collections for Statistical Language Model Adaptation in Speech Recognition\" by Fujii, Itou, and Ishikawa addresses the issues associated with using speech as input to an information retrieval task and shows several results in this area (integration,  adaptation).Another aspect of user expectations that has a huge impact on all parts of an application is a \"real-time\" requirement. In every day life, people expect an immediate response during discourse. The work by Coden and Brown focuses on this real-time aspect and the paper \"WASABI: Framework for Real-Time Speech Analysis Applications (demo)\" summarizes a demonstration given at the workshop of two systems that address this issue within a comprehensive framework and architecture.  Abstract. Several years of research have suggested that the accuracy of spoken document retrieval systems is not adversely affected by speech recognition errors. Even with error rates of around 40%, the effectiveness of an IR system falls less than 10%. The paper hypothesizes that this robust behavior is the result of repetition of important words in the text-meaning that losing one or two occurrences is not cripplingand the result of additional related words providing a greater contextmeaning that those words will match even if the seemingly critical word is misrecognized. This hypothesis is supported by examples from TREC's SDR track, the TDT evaluation, and some work showing the impact of recognition errors on spoken queries.\nIR and ASRInformation Retrieval (IR) research encompasses algorithms that process large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured information, though most work has been done with human-generated text. Search engines (such as those on the Web) are a highly visible outgrowth of IR research, where the problem is to present a list of documents (e.g., Web pages) that are likely to be relevant to a user's query. All of the techniques that are needed to find documents, to extract their key concepts, to recognize and avoid \"spam\" words, to rank the likely matches, and to elicit feedback from the user, etc., are aspects of IR.\n1In the last several years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have become commercially available. Their introduction extends the realm of IR to include not just text but also audio documents and queries. That is, a passage of speech can be processed by an ASR \"speech to text\" system and then traditional text-based IR techniques can be employed to help the user locate speeches of 1 The field of Information Retrieval naturally includes myriad other research issues, ranging from formal modeling of the problem to engineering systems that work across languages, from document clustering to multi-document summarization, and from classification to question answering. In this paper I will focus on search engine technology, though many of the ideas and directions apply equally well to other IR research problems. interest-directly from the audio (rather, automatically generated text) and not from a human-generated transcript. Unfortunately, ASR systems are imperfect. Although they do well enough to be marketed commercially, they still make large numbers of errors in the recognition process. The result is an automatically generated transcript where numerous words have been interchanged with other words that (usually) sound vaguely similar to the original. This corruption of the words is potentially a significant problem for IR systems that rely primarily on word matching to find relevant documents.Even before ASR systems were available as commercial products, IR and ASR researchers had begun work toward exploring interactions between the two fields. The results were somewhat surprising: even tremendous numbers of speech recognition errors in a spoken document had little impact on retrieval effectiveness. Yes, there were theoretical situations where even a single error could make a system fail completely. However, those problems did not seem to crop up in experimental settings.In the rest of this paper, I will discuss my feelings about why ASR errors have not been a major problem for IR to date. In Section 3 I will support those ideas by reviewing several research papers that explored those ideas. Then, in Section 4 I will show where IR systems begin to break down in the presence of ASR errors, allowing me to claim in Section 5 that significant and interesting open problems remain. I will conclude in Section 6 by discussing several opportunities and additional problems that may arise in the future.\nWhy ASR Is Not a Problem for IRWhy might recognition errors cause problems for information retrieval? Since IR techniques rely fundamentally on matching words and phrases in documents to corresponding items in the query, any process that corrupts the document may cause problems. Indeed, if a critical query term were corrupted in the document, there seems no chance of successful retrieval at all! I believe this issue is something of a red herring. It is indeed a possibility, but it is not likely to be an issue often. The reason is that documents contain numerous words and it is unlikely that all of them will be corrupted-even a 50% word error rate means that at least half of the words are correct. Other occurrences of that \"critical query term\" may be properly recognized-and if it is a critical word in the documents, it is almost a given that it will be repeated. Further, even if by some chance all occurrences of that critical term were misrecognized, the documents include numerous other words that provide a context for that word, and their appearance is likely to compensate for the missing word (for example, the word earthquake might have words such as quake, tremor, and aftershock providing added context). This theory does, of course, require that queries include multiple words so that context is available.The reason ASR errors are fairly easily tolerated is the same reason that word sense disambiguation is rarely a problem in information retrieval. There is an idea that one way to improve the effectiveness of IR systems is to develop a technique for automatically disambiguating the user's query: does bank refer Perspectives on Information Retrieval and Speech 3 to money or rivers, does fly refer to airplanes, insects, or trousers? In theory, if a system could automatically figure out the sense of the word intended by the user, retrieval false alarms could be reduced. [11]   However, an ambiguous query word can be made clear by the addition of one or two additional words just as easily: bank loan, river bank, fly a plane, or buzzing fly. In all those cases a single additional content word means that the problem of an ambiguous query has essentially been removed. Now consider what would happen if that single word were surrounded by an entire document that talked about the same topic. A document that talks about flying a plane will include various forms of the root fly, as well as things that are flown, things one does to prepare to fly, while flying, and so on. Most documents contain a huge amount of context that support the single word, meaning that that term is much less important than it might seem initially.To be sure, ambiguity can be a problem (the query fly is always ambiguous) and the corruption of that single word in an ASR document might be unrecoverable. However, in the same way that additional words can disambiguate a query, they can also prevent even moderate levels of ASR errors from dropping IR effectiveness too much.In the next section I will briefly outline a set of experiments from TREC and TDT that support my hypothesis. In Section 4 I will show where ASR errors begin to have an impact on IR effectiveness.\nSpoken DocumentsThere have been two major multi-site evaluations that explored the impact of ASR errors on document retrieval and organization. In this section, I outline TREC's and TDT's efforts in that direction, and show how their results are consistent with the hypothesis above.\nTREC 1997 to 2000From 1997 (TREC-6) through 2000 (TREC-9), the TREC evaluation workshop included a track on \"spoken document retrieval\" (SDR). [7,9,8,6] The purpose of the track was to explore the impact of ASR errors on document retrieval. The SDR track followed on the heels of the \"confusion\" track that examined the same question for errors created by OCR (optical character recognition) scanning of documents. [10]   An excellent paper by Garofolo, Auzanne, and Voorhees  summarizes the first three years of the SDR track and comes to conclusions similar to mine. The summary results below are largely due to their analysis. After TREC-9 completed, the conclusion was essentially that SDR is a \"solved problem\" and that TREC's efforts would be better spent on more challenging problems.In 1997 (TREC-6) the SDR track was a pilot study to explore how difficult the task would be. A small evaluation corpus of about 50 hours of speech, comprising almost 1500 stories, was used along with 50 \"known item\" queries. That is, the queries were constructed such that there would be a single document known to 4 J. Allan contain the answer, and such that it was known precisely which document that was (though not by the systems). The reason for the small corpus was that in 1997, recognizing 50 hours of speech was time-consuming, and that was about the limits of technology. The reason for using known item search rather than ranked retrieval is that the former is substantially simpler to assess. The conclusion of TREC-6 was that ASR errors caused about a 10% drop in effectiveness (i.e., ability to find that known document at the top of the ranked list). The drop seemed to be consistent, regardless of whether the queries were deemed easy or problematic for ASR errors.The following year, TREC-7 made the problem more challenging by switching to ranked retrieval where there are multiple relevant documents per query. The corpus grew to 87 hours (almost 2900 stories-still very small by IR standards) but only 23 queries were used. Most sites ran their IR systems on a range of ASR outputs, providing a window into the impact of ASR errors (word error rate) on effectiveness. The results showed a clear progressive impact from increasing ASR errors, but only a small drop in effectiveness (here, average precision) even when the word error rate climbed to 30-40%.In TREC-8 (1999), the corpus was made substantially larger so that it was somewhat \"reasonable\" by IR standards: 550 hours, making up almost 22,000 stories. This time, 50 queries were used in the evaluation. The result: word error rate had minimal impact on average precision. In fact, the results were comparable to the TREC-7 results, even though the corpus was an order of magnitude larger.TREC's involvement with SDR ended in 2000 with TREC-9. In that case, the corpus was the same as in the previous year, and the same number of queries were used. Again, the ASR errors had minimal impact.Interestingly, substantially shorter queries were used for TREC-9. For example, here are two forms of the same query: -short: Name some countries which permit their citizens to commit suicide with medical assistance -terse: assisted suicide A \"short\" query means there is much less context within the query, so one might expect the effectiveness to drop. However, the \"terse\" queries were more effective than the \"short\" queries. This unlikely result may be because of how queries were constructed. In the example listed, the terse query is a phrase that is probably used commonly to describe the issue, whereas the longer query does not include the same important phrase.Throughout the TREC SDR evaluations, even error rates of about 40% had only a modest impact on IR effectiveness. The length of the recognized speech provided enough repetition of important words, and enough related contextual words, that the IR retrieval methods could readily compensate for the ASR errors.\nTDT 1998The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) evaluation workshop investigates ways that broadcast news stories can be automatically organized by the events they Perspectives on Information Retrieval and Speech 5 discuss.[2] That is, all stories about the Oklahoma City bombing should be grouped together, as should stories about a particular earthquake, or a specific political rally. All TDT tasks are carried out on a stream of arriving news stories rather than on a static collection. Because the focus of the work is on broadcast news-i.e., audio streams-speech recognition has always been a key component of TDT.Tasks in TDT include automatically segmenting the broadcast news stream into topically coherent stories, grouping all stories discussing a particular event together, identifying when a new (previously unseen) event appears in the news, and tracking an event given a handful of on-topic stories. All of these tasks were carried out using both human-generated and ASR-generated transcripts. Note that in contrast to the IR task, \"queries\" do not exist: most of the tasks require comparing stories to each other, meaning that a \"query\" is effectively an entire document, or even a handful of documents.The TDT 1998 evaluation used two months worth of news from several sources, approximately 13,000 news stories.2 The results were:-For tracking, ASR errors had a modest impact on effectiveness, but not a substantial drop.[13] -For clustering the stories into topics, the ASR errors had almost no impact on effectiveness.[4] -When detecting the onset of a new event, ASR errors did have a substantially greater impact.[1]It is not entirely clear why ASR errors had a larger impact on the new event detection. I suspect it is because the task itself is so difficult (effectiveness is generally poor) that ASR errors have a large impact on the ideal parameters for the approach-that is, that better and more training data may find parameters that close the gap. For two of the TDT tasks, the ASR errors appeared to have little impact. In all three tasks, the effectiveness drop because of ASR errors was very small compared to the overall error rate of the tasks.\nSpoken QueriesThe previous section shows that document retrieval and comparison are fairly robust to ASR errors, even as high as 40% word error rate. Those results support my hypothesis that the long documents alleviate the expected problems due to \"out of vocabulary\" and otherwise misrecognized words.In this section I look at the other end of the spectrum. Suppose the recognized items were much smaller-e.g., the queries rather than the documents. What, then, would be the impact of ASR errors? According to the hypothesis, the shorter duration of speech will provide less context and redundancy, and ASR errors should have a greater impact on effectiveness.2 The TREC-8 and TREC-9 corpus was created from three months of the TDT training data as well as the TDT evaluation data.\nJ. AllanOne group of researchers who investigated this problem [3] considered two experiments. In the first experiment, they recorded 35 TREC queries (topics 101-135). These were quite long queries by modern standards, ranging from 50-60 words, so one might expect that the impact of ASR would not be great. They modified their speech recognition system to produce word error rates of about 25, 33, and 50%. They found that in comparison to an accurate transcription (i.e., the original TREC query), the precision at 30 and at 500 documents dropped about 10% for up to 33% word error rate, and about 15% for the 50% rate. Interestingly, the very top of the ranked list (precision at 5 documents retrieved) saw an improvement of 2-4%. These drops in effectiveness are comparable to those seen when documents contained recognition errors.The same researchers tried another set of substantially shorter queries. Here they created their own queries of three lengths: 2-4, 5-8, and 10-15 content words. The queries were controlled to ensure that there would be a reasonable number of relevant documents retrieved with the accurate transcription of the query (against a corpus of about 25,000 Boston Globe news stories). In this case, the results showed substantial drop in effectiveness, ranging from about 35% worse for 30% word error rate, to 60% worse at 50%. As the queries got slightly longer, the drop in effectiveness became less.  summarizes the results from their study. These results were verified by Crestani [5]  who did some deeper analysis of the long queries. He showed that the ASR degradation was uniform across a range of recall levels (rather than just at a few cutoff points). He also broke the long queries into two groups, longer and shorter than 28 words. He showed that although both groups degrade in the presence of ASR errors, the longer \"long\" queries are consistently more accurate than the shorter \"long\" queries.Two groups have independently found that the effectiveness of IR systems degrades faster in the presence of ASR errors when the queries are recognized than when the documents are recognized. Further, once queries are less than 30 words, the degradation in effectiveness becomes even more pronounced. These results suggest that there is a minimum number of words necessary for the redundancy and context effects to overcome problems due to ASR errors.\nPerspectives on Information Retrieval and Speech 7\nWhy ASR Is Still an IssueIn Section 3 IR and ASR was described as a solved problem. The previous section shows that this claim is not valid when the recognized item is the query and not the document-at least, not when the query is shorter than about 30 words. For document retrieval, long enough spans of speech can be readily handled.However, information retrieval is not just about document retrieval. There are other problems in and around IR where ASR is still likely to be a problem. To see where those are likely to be, consider any technology that works on fairly short spans of text. Such a technology, when faced with ASR errors, is unlikely to find enough context and enough redundancy to compensate for the recognition failure. For such technologies, a single word incorrectly processed could theoretically have a profound impact.What does this mean in terms of open problems related to speech within information retrieval systems? Here are several issues that crop up because of the length of the material being used:-Spoken questions of short duration. As shown in Section 4, the drop in effectiveness is large for short spoken queries. How can the ASR be improved for very small snippets of speech? Is it possible for the IR system to guess that the recognition may be bad-because, for example, the query words do not make sense together? Is it just a user interface issue, where people need to be encouraged to talk longer? -Message-length documents. Since short spoken items are the problem, what happens when the documents are substantially shorter? For example, voicemail messages, announcements, and so on. -Question answering. Current technologies to solve the problem of question answering (returning a specific answer to a question rather than just a document) tend to focus on small passages of text that are likely to contain the answer. Finding small passages in the presence of ASR errors may be an issue-and the natural language processing needed to analyze the passages may also fail. -User interfaces. Spoken documents often come grouped together (e.g., a news show with several stories) and need to be broken into segments. How can a user interface properly handle those segments, particularly when the segmentation is likely to contain errors? How can a user \"skim\" an audio recording to find out whether it is, indeed, relevant? It is possible to skim text, but audio must be processed linearly. Can a system provide hints to a user to help in this process?\nCan ASR Systems Help ASR/IR?To address the open problems, it seems useful to consider what information an ASR system might provide rather than just the resulting transcript. reliably extracted from speech, but the \"color\" it provides to the text may be critical in some applications. For example, consider the value added if it were possible for a system to use prosodic information to isolate sarcasm. -Language models. ASR systems generally contain a language model that provides word sequence probabilities. Some information retrieval systems also rely on language models for retrieval. It is likely that some information could be usefully shared across the two types of models.\nFocusing the SystemAnother possibility for improving the capabilities of an IR system on spoken data is to focus its attention on a specific person or domain.-Voice-id. Knowing who the speaker is would allow an IR system to bring a user-specific language or topic model to bear when processing the query. Such a model might clarify terms that would otherwise be ambiguous, providing a context for the likely meaning of the terms. -Domain knowledge. Both ASR and IR could benefit from collection-specific models of language use: knowing that the user is querying a medical database should make it possible to do better recognition, and to handle the retrieval better. If the system is targeted to a specific task (e.g., a tourist information kiosk), it could adapt both parts of the system, too. -User interaction. Recognizing how the user is interacting with the system might provide useful feedback. For example, if the user is getting annoyed (e.g., more stress in the voice), the IR system might be able to try alternative ways of processing the query, or might ask the user for clarification, and so on.\nOpportunities and ProblemsThe success of spoken document retrieval allows the consideration of a much wider range of applications. In this final section, I briefly mention some of the interesting directions that research could go (by no means an exhaustive list!). In doing that, I am also highlighting the problems that ASR/IR systems currently have and that need to be surmounted.Perspectives on Information Retrieval and Speech 9\nNew PossibilitiesReadily available speech recognition has made some things possible that had rarely been considered before. Retrieval of spoken documents is the most obvious possibility. But a range of new applications are now available:-Coping with very short queries; -User interface design to encourage longer spoken queries; -Helping a user decide of a spoken document is a match to his or her query; -Summarizing speech; -Adapting ASR language models to the collection being searched; -Coping with collections that contain a mixture of ASR and clean text documents (typically the latter are more highly ranked); -Dealing with other types of spoken documents such as dialogues, meetings, lectures, classes, etc. -Contexts where the word error rate is well over 50% -Text interfaces to speech-only systems (e.g., voicemail)\nHas ASR/IR Helped IR?Earlier I mentioned some ways that ASR might be able to help IR, by conveying more information from the recognition process to the IR system. The process of integrating IR and ASR has helped non-ASR retrieval as well, though in subtler ways. ASR techniques have resulted in more robust weighting schemes, in techniques that should be able to cope with misspellings, and with the idea that it makes sense to expand a document rather than a query.\nConclusionIn this paper I have claimed that for classic information retrieval tasks such as document retrieval, speech recognition errors generally are either inconsequential or can be dealt with using simple techniques. I have softened that somewhat with the acknowledgment that recognition errors are and will be an issue for any language-based technology that looks primarily at small spans of text. When there are only a few words available, there is no opportunity for repetition and context to compensate for errors.I believe that the interesting challenges ahead for speech applications and information retrieval are suggested by a broader use of spoken documents. What does it mean to retrieve a meeting? How can IR systems cope with the misstatements, corrections, and disfluencies that are common in less formal speech? Can IR systems benefit from recognition systems that \"clean up\" the speech as it is transcribed-e.g., adding punctuation, etc?Finally, and perhaps the biggest challenge, is how user interfaces can be designed to make it possible for people to sift through spoken documents as rapidly as they can pick through clean text? The inherent linearity of speech prevents rapid scanning, and current recognition error rates make it possible to retrieve accurately, but do not necessarily allow a human to get a good \"gist\" of a retrieved item.

The underlying assumption of this approach is that these segments will capture passages in the transcript relevant to the query. Our experiments investigate the use of two lexical coherence based segmentation algorithms (Text-Tiling, C99). These are run on the provided manual and ASR transcripts, and the ASR transcript with stop words removed.

We describe the collections used in the workshop, detailing the composition of the collections in terms of geographic and temporal expressions. The first contribution of this work is the collections' statistics, which by itself reveals the relevance of this subject. Our parsing techniques found millions of references related with the dimensions of relevance time and space. Those references were used to index the documents in order to score them in those dimensions. We also introduce a technique to find extra references in Wikipedia using Google Search Service and the same parsers used in the collections. Those references were used in four different scenarios depending on the queries: first we used the references found in topics to filter documents without geographic or temporal expressions and used pseudo relevance feedback to expand topics with no references using the indexes created for places and dates; in other approach we used the Wikipedia references to filter documents from the result set, in a last approach we expanded all topics with the Wikipedia references. Finally we used another technique based on metric distances calculated through coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) and dates in order to create a scope for documents and topics, and rank them according to the distance between each other.

We propose a combination of four language models (LM) representing different semantic roles and scopes of models for documents and a rank aggregation method. The rationale is based on observation that sentence-based language models using SRL retrieved relevant documents that are not ranked high by a general LM approach. Although we did not get the comparison result between the general model and our proposed method from NTCIR-9 minutely, we obtained meaningful improvement with the NTCIR-8 GeoTime corpus. Given that the current result is based on our initial effort under the time limitation, we believe that further exploration along the idea of using SRL would give a significant improvement in the geotemporal information retrieval.

This paper describes a Japanese spoken document retrieval system that is robust for considering OOV words and mis-recognition of subunits. Additionally our system combines Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognizer(LVCSR) and a sub-word unit recognition system for In-Vocabulary(IV) words.

Our proposed system aims to support such process by providing a chart-based interface, which displays two charts side by side and permits a user to overlay the two charts for comparison, and then accesses the original texts.

A special component of re-ranking for enhancing performance of geographic and temporal searches was added to the KOLIS system, in which standard Okapi BM25 and probabilistic pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) were implemented. That is, at the first stage, a list of documents relevant to a given topic was specified by standard IR techniques, and at the second stage, the list was re-ranked after scores of documents which included geographic and temporal terms were increased. In particular, each score of documents including a syntactic pattern \"geographic or temporal term + \" was augmented for improving search performance where \" \" is a functional word meaning \"at\" or \"in\". In the old version of reranking used in the former NTCIR-8 workshop, only frequency of occurrence of geographic and temporal terms was taken into consideration. In this experiment of Japanese monolingual (JA-JA) retrieval and English to Japanese bilingual (EN-JA) retrieval, the search runs using jointly the re-ranking based on the syntactic pattern and PRF showed the highest performance.

However, users' queries are usually short, so that search engines may not have enough information to determine their exact intents. How to diversify web search results to cover users' possible intents as wide as possible is an important research issue. In this paper, we will propose several subtopic mining approaches and show how to diversify the search results by the mined subtopics. For Subtopic Mining subtask, we explore various subtopic mining algorithms that mine subtopics of a query from enormous documents on the web. For Document Ranking subtask, we propose re-ranking algorithms that keep the top-ranked results to contain as many popular subtopics as possible. The re-ranking algorithms apply sub-topics mined from subtopic mining algorithms to diversify the search results.

The RITE task consists of four subtasks, simplified Chinese binary classification (CS_BC), simplified Chinese multi-way classification (CS_MC), traditional Chinese binary classification (CT_BC), and traditional Chinese multi-way classification (CT_MC). According to the definitions of these subtasks, a machine learning based classification framework is proposed and tested under various setups.

As such, it has been considered an impractical technology from the perspective of the real world application. However, the situation surrounding NLU has been changing rapidly. We have witnessed large knowledge resources being constructed, manually or automatically from huge collection of text and structured data bases in Web. We have also witnessed significant amount observation data of user behaviors being accumulated in the forms of query logs, query-click logs, networks among users, etc. These observation data will shed (and actually are shedding) light on how linguistic expressions and their interpretation interact in context. What was considered impractical as research scenario five years ago is now being taken as serious research and application scenario. In this talk, I will discuss how the three fields of natural language understanding, semantic-based information retrieval and knowledge management are being evolved into a single unified research field and how semantics of text and intentions manifested in user queries are to be computationally manipulated.

In contrast to traditional Web search which requires the user to scan a ranked list of URLs, visit individual URLs and gather pieces of information he needs, 1CLICK aims to satisfy the user with a single textual output, immediately after the user clicks on the SEARCH button. Systems are expected to present important pieces of information first and to minimise the amount of text the user has to read. As our first trial, we designed a Japanese 1CLICK task with a nugget-based test collection. Three research teams participated in the task, using diverse approaches (information extraction, passage retrieval and summarisation). Our results suggest that the 1CLICK evaluation framework is a useful complement to traditional 10-blue-link evaluation. We therefore hope to expand the language scope in the next round, at NTCIR-10.

To tackle the data set with complicated syntactic and semantic phenomena, the authors used a classication method to predict entailment relations between two dierent texts. These features were used for classication: (1) Tree edit distance and operations, (2) Word overlap ratios and word pairs, (3) Sentiment polarity matching, (4) Character overlap ratios, (5) Head comparisons, (6) Predicate-argument structure matching, and (7) Temporal expression matching. Feature (1) reects the operations in the edit distance computation between the text and the hypothesis, which can capture the syntactic dierences between two sentences. In the RITE task, Feature (1) is eective for the MC subtask and Feature (7) is eective for the EXAM subtask. Syntactic Difference Based Approach for NTCIR-9 RITE Task"}

We also develop some methods to re-rank the subtopics and remove reduplicate ones with query log and search result snippets in search engines. In the document ranking task, methods applied to diversify English documents are used to validate their effectiveness on Chinese pages, such as HITS, Novelty-Result Selection and Documents Duplication Elimination.

INTENT task is a new NTCIR task which consists of two subtasks: (1) Subtopic Mining subtask: given a query, a system lists all possible subtopics that might cover users' different intents. Our approach is mining the query log to find subtopics candidates and rank them according to the frequencies of each candidate. (2) Document Ranking subtask: given a query, a system returns diversified document URLs that might cover users' diversified intents. Since the document set is larger than the capacity of PC. Our approach is to construct a distributed framework that can search a partial document set by one PC at a time and merge the partial search results to get the final ranking list.

A straightforward assumption was proposed for achieving this aim: the relation between two sentences was determined by the different parts between them instead of the identical parts. Therefore, we considered features including sentence lengths, the content of matched keywords, quantities of matched keywords, and their parts of speech to capture the difference between two sentences.

The development of spoken term detection (STD) techniques, which detect a given word or phrase from spoken documents, is widely conducted. This paper proposes a new method of STD based on the vector quantization (VQ). Spoken documents are represented as sequences of VQ codes, and they are matched with a text query to be detected based on the V-P score which measures the relationship between a VQ code and a phoneme. The representation of VQ codes is an intermediate form between acoustic features such as MFCC parameters and sub-word symbols which are often used in conventional STD methods.

MT systems typically ignore and directly output unknown or OOV source words into the target translation. On the other hand, for words which do not couple with their preceding or following words as phrases, as referred to as singletons, MT systems typically leave their translation disambiguation to language model within which knowledge is somewhat limited and determined by the preset length of words.

For example, the question \"The President believes our military mission in Afghanistan is a vital national interest-agree/disagree?\" is quite different from the question: \"Do you believe that a military mission in Afghanistan is in the USA's vital national interest?\" Response variation according to different question wording has been studied by researchers in survey methodology. However the influence on search results from variations of topic wording has not been examined for geotemporal information retrieval. For the GeoTime evaluation in NTCIR Workshop 9, the organizers decided to attempt to do an experiment in query variability in order to study variability of performance. We took a single information need and expressed it in three different ways: 1) as a single event question, 2) as a question which would yield an open-ended list (e.g. the classic \"which countries did the Pope visit in the last three years\"), or 3) a reformulation or the single event question as a location (latitude/longitude) and time inquiry. This paper reports the results of this micro-analysis of variation effects upon a single query expressed in different formats, as well as the degree of success (or failure) which we achieved (or did not achieve) our explicit goal of being able to distinguish performance outcomes for the different formulations.

These frameworks usually do not consider the subtopic taxonomy information. Many previous works on document ranking have shown that different kinds of information needs require different ranking strategies to be satisfied. It is thus necessary to involve subtopic taxonomy in the evaluation framework of search result diversification. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Subtopic Taxonomy-Aware (STA) framework to redefine the existing measures. Measures in this new framework take the subtopic taxonomy information into consideration for diversity evaluations. On the other hand, finding the optimal diversified results of many measures is proved as a NPhard problem. We also propose a pruning algorithm which can decrease this problem to a computable search.

Four aspect queries per one original query were created manually by fifteen numbers of college students. By collecting the top ranked documents in retrieved sets generated by various queries, aspect query based pseudo gold standard is generated. In order to demonstrate its feasibility, we compared rank ordering based on human judgment and pseudo judgments. Experimental results showed the high correlations of 0.863 (p<0.01).

Because of the great importance of this activity for patients and clinicians and the effect that incorrect information may have on health outcomes, it is critical to present relevant and valuable information to a searcher. Previous evaluation campaigns on health information retrieval (IR) have provided benchmarks that have been widely used to improve health IR and record these improvements. However, in general these benchmarks have targeted the specialised information needs of physicians and other healthcare workers. In this paper, we describe the development of a new collection for evaluation of effectiveness in IR seeking to satisfy the health information needs of patients. Our methodology features a novel way to create statements of patients' information needs using realistic short queries associated with patient discharge summaries, which provide details of patient disorders. We adopt a scenario where the patient then creates a query to seek information relating to these disorders. Thus, discharge summaries provide us with a means to create contextually driven search statements, since they may include details on the stage of the disease, family history etc. The collection will be used for the first time as part of the ShARe/-CLEF 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab, which focuses on natural language processing and IR for clinical care.

Track participants returned travel suggestions that included brief descriptions, where the availability of these descriptions allows users to quickly skip suggestions that are not of interest to them. A user's reaction to a suggestion could be negative (\"dislike\"), as well as positive (\"like\") or neutral, and too many disliked suggestions may cause the user to abandon the results. Neither of these factors are handled appropriately by traditional evaluation methodologies for information retrieval and recommendation.

In making this proposal, we aim to avoid the potential for ambiguity and greater cognitive load associated with standard graded relevance judgments. Under our proposal, we first decompose a retrieval topic into a number of informational nuggets. For each document, a binary judgment is made with respect to each nugget. The ratio of relevant nuggets to total nuggets becomes the graded relevance value assigned to that document. To provide support for this idea, we turn to test collections created for the TREC Web Track. Along with the usual graded relevance judgments required by traditional effectiveness measures, these test collections include topic decompositions created for the purpose of evaluating novelty and diversity. By exploiting these test collections for our own purposes, we demonstrate a clear relationship between our proposed method and traditional graded relevance. In addition to supporting our proposal, our experiments suggest that informational nuggets can provide a unified approach to relevance assessment, supporting both traditional effectiveness measures and newer measures of novelty and diversity.

The Leave One Out (LOO) test is useful for testing whether the test collections are actually reusable: that is, whether the non-contributors can be evaluated fairly relative to the contributors' official performances. In contrast, at the recent web search result diversification tasks of TREC and NTCIR, diversity test collections have been built using shallow pools: the pool depths lie between 20 and 40. Thus it is unlikely that these diversity test collections are reusable: in fact, the organisers of these diversity tasks never claimed that they are. Nevertheless, these collections are also used a posteriori by non-contributors. In light of this, Sakai et al.

The data produced during an evaluation campaign of IRSs are valuable scientific data, and as a consequence, their lineage should be tracked since it allows us to judge the quality and applicability of information for a given use; those data should be enriched progressively adding further analyses and interpretations on them; it should be possibile to cite them and their further elaboration, since this is an effective way for explicitly mentioning and making references to useful information, for improving the cooperation among researchers and to facilitate the transfer of scientific and innovative results from research groups to the industrial sector.

However, the NTCIR-6 Crosslingual Task has finally started adopting graded-relevance metrics, though only as additional metrics. This paper compares three existing graded-relevance metrics that were mentioned in the Call for Participation of the NTCIR-6 Crosslingual Task in terms of the ability to control how severely \"late arrival\" of relevant documents should be penalised.

On the other hand, user-in-the-loop evaluations are expensive, unrepeatable and often inconclusive. In light of this, we propose a new task for NTCIR that aims to directly measure the correlation between user satisfaction and evaluation metric values.

It uses Robertson's 2-Poisson model and Rocchio's formula, both of which are known to be effective. Characteristics of newspapers such as locational information are used. We present our application of Fujita's method, where longer terms are used in retrieval by the system but de-emphasized relative to the emphasis on the shortest terms. This allows us to use both compound and single-word terms. The statistical test used in expanding queries through an automatic feedback process is described. The method gives us terms that have been statistically shown to be related to the top-ranked documents obtained in the first retrieval. We also use a numerical term, QIDF, which is an IDF term for queries. QIDF decreases the scores for stop words that occur in many queries. It can be very useful for foreign languages for which we cannot determine stop words. We also use web-based unknown word translation for bilingual information retrieval. We participated in two monolingual information retrieval tasks (Korean and Japanese) and five bilingual information retrieval tasks (Chinese-Japanese, English-Japanese, Japanese-Korean, Korean-Japanese, and English-Korean) at NTCIR-6.

We propose a method for extracting trend information from multiple newspaper articles and blogs, and visualizing the information as graphs. As target texts for extraction of trend information, the MuST (Multimodal Summarization for Trend Information) workshop focuses on newspaper articles. In addition to newspapers, we focus on blogs, because useful information for analysing trend information is often written in blogs, such as the reasons for increases/decreases of statistics and the impact of increases/decreases of statistics on society. To extract trend information, we extract temporal expressions and statistical values, and we devised methods for both operations. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted some experiments. We obtained a recall of 6.3% and precision of 31.3% for newspaper articles, and a recall of 44.8% and precision of 60.3% for blogs. From the error analysis, we found that most errors in newspaper articles were caused by misconversion of temporal expressions such as \" \" (the same year) or \" \" (the previous month), into \"YYYY-MM-DD\" form, although temporal expressions were detected correctly. In contrast to newspaper articles, there are few temporal expressions in blogs for which resolution is required, such as \" \" (the same day) or \" \" (the previous month). As a result, recall and precision for blogs are higher than those for newspaper articles. Extraction and Visualization of Trend Information from Newspaper Articles and Blogs"}

The multi-topic classifier was constructed on the basis of the maximum margin principle and applied to multiple F-term classification. From the experimental results, this multi-topic classifier yielded a higher F1 value than the one-vs-rest SVM in many cases. In addition, we employed the one-vs-rest SVM classifier. The SVM classifier has certain drawbacks such as low recall performance and large learning time. In order to solve these problems, we used heuristics for achieving random reduction of a part of the negative examples and division of learning.

In this paper, we describe our approach on Chinese Single Language Information Retrieval (SLIR) task and English-Chinese Bilingual CLIR task (BLIR). We use both bi-grams and single Chinese characters as index units and use OKAPI BM25 as retrieval model. The initial retrieved documents are reranked before they are used to do standard query expansion. Our document re-ranking method is done by a label propagation-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to utilize the intrinsic structure underlying in the large document data. Since no labeled relevant or irrelevant documents are generally available in IR, our approach tries to extract some pseudo labeled documents from the ranking list of the initial retrieval. For pseudo relevant documents, we determine a cluster of documents from the top ones via cluster validation-based k-means clustering; for pseudo irrelevant ones, we pick a set of documents from the bottom ones. Then the ranking of the documents can be conducted via label propagation.

During the categorization phase, we allow any patent to be classified into multiple categories, which allows patent document overlaps among different categories. Then, for each category, we applied dimensional reduction using LSI to each category into a much lower dimension.

We introduce a Pattern Matched Translation Extraction (PMTE) approach to the analysis of mixed-languages web pages, which makes use of pattern matching to automatically extract the translation pairs. The experiment results demonstrated the proposed method is effective when translating Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) terms, a wellknown problem in fields of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), question-answering (QA), machine translation (MT) and knowledge discovery (KD). We also report the experiment results of single-language information retrieval (SLIR) and illustrate the performance through different collections in STAGE 2 of NTCIR-6.

In monolingual Chinese QA, questions are classified based on cue-word and meta-keyword usage patterns. Retrieval is done using sentence units, and indexing is based on bigrams and characters. Entities extracted from retrieved sentences form a pool of answer candidates which are ranked using five evidence factors. Our best monolingual result shows that when only Top1 answers are considered, 63 questions out of 150 are answered correctly with sentence support, giving an accuracy and MRR of 0.42. When unsupported answers are included, these values improve to 0.4467. English-Chinese CLQA starts with English question classification also based on an approach similar to Chinese. Three paths of translation render the question into Chinese strings. Otherwise procedures of retrieval and answer ranking remain the same as monolingual but with different parameter values. Our best run returns corresponding Top1 values as: .2533 and .28 (unsupported). These are about 60% of monolingual effectiveness within our system. Effectiveness with Top2-5 answers as well as the influence of different evidence factors are also reported.

Stage-2 submissions, which consists of repeating previous experiments, were on time. These NTCIR-6 experiments were conducted as new without referring to any previous knowledge about the runs. Comparisons with old results however were less favorable for about half the runs. We traced this to the accidental use of an outdated module which sets the Zipf high frequency threshold too low, and leads to too many high frequency terms being removed from a query. Some runs are new and not submitted previously by us. These include: 'title' queries for NTCIR-3 monolingual Chinese and English-Chinese CLIR, and the English-Chinese CLIR runs for NTCIR-4.

Our opinion detection technique is based on sentiment lexicons. We explored three main issues: the effect of the size of sentiment lexicons on the accuracy of opinionated sentence identification and of polarity decisions, the effect of a simple approximation to anaphora resolution on the accuracy of opinion holder identification, and the effect of sentence expansion on the effectiveness of relevant sentence retrieval.

Therefore, we focused on these two question types. For 'definition' questions, we used a simple pattern-based approach. For 'why' questions, hand-crafted rules were used in previous work for answer candidate extraction [5]. However, such rules greatly depend on developers' intuition and are costly to make. We adopt a supervised machine learning approach. We collected causal expressions from the EDR corpus and trained a causal expression classifier, integrating lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. The experimental results show that our system is effective for 'why' and 'definition' questions. NTT's Question Answering System for NTCIR-6 QAC-4"}

We introduce a lexical information based approach to this task by exploiting lexical information, based on the quantitative analysis of opinions in the news articles. The method comprises semi-supervised subjectivity classification, gloss based sentiment classification, and rule based opinion holder finder.

Hence an important retrieval scenario, seeking just one item to answer a question, is not properly evaluated by the traditional ad hoc retrieval measures. Also, for each language, we submitted a one-percent subset of the first 9000 retrieved items to investigate the frequency of relevant items at deeper ranks than the official judging depth of 100.

In this task, large numbers of patent applications are classified into Fterm categories. Therefore, a patent classification system requires high classification speed, as well as high classification accuracy. The chi-square statistic can calculate the frequency of word appearance in the F-term and the frequency of word non-appearance in the F-term. The proposed method treats words as a scalar value and a ranking algorithm simply adds the word values of each word included in the test patent document in each F-term. Therefore, the proposed method provides classification that is significantly faster than other methods. The proposed method is evaluated in A-precision, R-precision, and F-measure. Although the proposed method did not obtain the best score, this method achieves a classification accuracy that is as high as those of other methods using machine learning or the vector classification method. In this task, the processing speed is not evaluated. Therefore, processing speed is also evaluated. The evaluation results show that the proposed method is much faster than that using the vector classification method.

Different from most existing opinion mining systems, which recognize opinionated sentences as one-step classification procedure, WIA-Opinmine adopts a multi-pass coarse-fine analysis strategy. A base classifier firstly coarsely estimates the opinion of sentences and the document. The obtained document-level and sentence-level opinions are then incorporated in a complex classifier to re-analyze the opinion of sentences to obtain refined sentence and document opinions. The updated opinion features are feed back to the complex classifier to further refine the opinion analysis. Such circles terminate until the analysis results converge. Similar strategy is adopted in sentence-topic relevance estimation. Furthermore, the mutual reinforcement between the analysis of sentence relevance and sentence opinion are integrated in one framework in WIA-Opinmine. Evaluations on NTCIR-7 MOAT Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese sides show that WIA-Opinmine achieves the best precisions performance in five subtasks and the best F performance in three subtasks including polarity determination, opinion holder recognition and opinion target recognition. This results show that the proposed framework integrating coarse-fine opinion mining strategy and the mutual reinforcement between the analysis of sentence relevance and sentence opinion is promising.

This simultaneity is strengths and weaknesses of the model. Although it enables the rules to be applied to the accurate and correct context, it deteriorates the applicability of the rules. In other words, the rules work very well in domains of training data, but they lost robustness in out of the domains. In this paper, we will try to improve the applicability of the original model by adding extra reordering templates which are separated out from hierarchical phrase translation rules. An original hierarchical phrase rule with two non-terminals is regarded as either monotone or swap reordering template according to if the two non-terminals in the source side have monotone or swap relation to the target side in the original rule.

Our system uses subjectivity lexicons to score the sentiment weight of a word, in addition with a weight that reflects the discriminating power of the word. We borrow some techniques from Information Retrieval because discovering the importance and discriminating power of a word in a collection of documents is a commonly dealt issue in information retrieval tasks.

In detecting opinionated sentences, an EM algorithm was proposed to extract the sentiment words based on the sentimental dictionary, and then an iterative algorithm was used to estimate the score of the sentiment words and the sentences. In detecting relevant sentences, we solve this problem by analogizing the task to the traditional information retrieval task. The difficulty lies in that some sentence is relevant to the topic even if there are no key words hit in it.

We focus mostly on the document re-ranking technique. We address probabilistically labeling relevant degree between the first retrieval documents and query topics. In other words, we want to know the probability of a document belongs to relevance/irrelevance class. We employ PU positive and unlabeled learning to solve this problem, and use Bayesian classifier and EM algorithm in process of computing the probability. Consequently, those relevant documents with high probability are updated rank. Lastly, we use re-ranked retrieved documents to do query expansion.

We adopt the pre-editing method, which divides sentences into clauses, and translate these clauses using the Moses SMT engine. The translation accuracy, BLEU, was 29.33%, so preediting has a small effect. Translation quality is degraded because the order of words is changed by not using information about other clauses.

Coherent structure means that the sentences that relate to a certain topic in an article are written in clusters to preserve the logical organization. To use the structure, our method makes blocks that consist of sentences in a window of a certain size, then estimates the score of each block, and judges each sentence from the scores. We applied our framework to opinion sentence extraction and topic relevant sentence extraction. In the result of our experiments, our framework achieved a very high recall ratio and a high F-value.

This is our first participation in this kind of retrieval and classification task in which we participated for the English, Japanese and traditional Chinese language. As a basic model we suggested a probabilistic model derived from Muller's method [1] that allows us to determine and weight terms (isolated words, bigram of words, noun phrases, etc.) belonging to a given category compared to the rest of the corpus. In the current task, the classification categories are positive, negative, neutral and not opinionated. To succeed at this classification task, we have adopted the logistic regression method in order to define the most probable category for each input sentence. Our participation was strongly motivated by the objective to suggest an approach on the polarity subtask of the MOAT with a minimal linguistic component.

The experiments are based on an analysis of text with respect to not only the vocabulary of content terms present in it (which most other approaches use as a basis for analysis) but also on structural features of the text as represented by presence of function words (in other approaches often removed by stop lists) and by presence of constructional features (typically disregarded by most other analyses). In our analysis, following a constructional grammatical framework, structural features are treated similarly to vocabulary features. Our results give us reason to conclude-provisionally, until more empirical verification experiments can be performed-that: \u2022 Linguistic structural information does help in establishing whether a sentence is opinionated or not; whereas \u2022 Linguistic information of this specific type does not help in distinguishing sentences of differing polarity.

For opinion extraction task, our algorithm was based on the bag-ofcharacter methods proposed in NTCIR-6 and considered morphological structures of Chinese words to extract opinion words more correctly. How distant an opinion word is to the end of the sentence is also considered to adjust its opinion weight. The performance of the opinion extraction, which is the second best of all participants, achieves the fmeasure 0.672 under the lenient metric and 0.783 under the strict metric.

To make phrase table, We have been used Och's method[3]. And this method sometimes generate completely wrong phrase table. We found that such phrase table caused by long parallel sentences. Therefore, we removed these long parallel sentences from training data. Also, we utilized general tools for statistical machine translation, such as \"Giza++\"[4], \"moses\"[5], and \"training-phrase-model.perl\"[6]. We obtained a BLEU score of 0.2229 of the Intrinsic-JE task and 0.2393 of the Intrinsic-EJ task for our proposed method. On the other hand, we obtained a BLEU score of 0.2162 of the Intrinsic-JE task and 0.2533 of the Intrinsic-EJ task for a standard method. This means that our proposed method was effective for the Intrinsic-JE task. However, it was not effective for the Intrinsic-EJ tasks. Also, our system was average performance of all system.

Two kinds of supervised approaches were employed here: 1) the supervised lexicon-based approach, and 2) machine learning approaches. Ensemble techniques were also used to combine the results given by different approaches. By making use of these approaches and ensemble methods in various combinations, we submitted three runs for each of the two subtasks we participated in: opinionated sentence recognition and opinion polarity classification. The results show that our system achieved state-of-the-art performance on both subtasks: the highest F-measure on the opinionated sentence recognition task and the second highest F-measure on the opinion polarity classification task amongst all runs submitted by seven participants. Furthermore, the ensemble combination of different classifiers markedly outperformed individual classifiers on the opinion polarity classification task, without showing much improvement, however, on the opinionated sentence recognition task.

Our method involves two different approaches: (1) the machine learning-based prototype system (on the basis of support vector machines (SVMs)) and (2) stochastic estimation of the character-level of words. The former were the real applications of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, while the latter comprises of adhoc opinioned word, phrase analysis. We submitted both two runs to NTCIR-MOAT in this year. The prototype system was first designed for traditional Chinese. We also directly port it to Simplified Chinese text with dictionary-based word translation. To make the model more robust, we present the idea of transdutive learning to our models. The main advantage of this approach is that it learns the hypothesis from labeled data meanwhile adapt to the large unlabeled data. Our method could not only be applied to SVM-based approaches, but also is applicable with the other nonmachine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that our method (approach 1) can effectively identify the opinioned sentences in 0.661 and 0.611 f-measure rates under the lenient test. In terms of polarity judgment, our method achieves 0.284 and 0.294 in F-measure rates of the proposed two approaches, respectively. In the relevant sentence judgment track, our group achieved the best and the second best results among all other participants. Owing to the lack of labeled training data, we trust that our method could be further enhanced by feeding with more consistent and large annotated corpus.

We examine verdicts for murder cases of the last 10 years using 149 newspaper articles (1998-2001) and 160 precedents from a database available online (2001-2007). The results showed that there is a tendency to give stricter verdicts for murder cases and clustered by CLUTO into five classes were judged as descriptive factors related to a crime method and lethal weapon usage. We also use similarity between cases for sentence estimation after filtering out inadequate factors by using previously retrieved precedents. Finally we confirmed that using similarity-based weights gives less erroneous sentence estimation than the baseline method lacking those weights.

PLs can be collected by individuals over very extended periods, potentially running to many years. Such archives have many potential applications including helping individuals recover partial forgotten information, sharing experiences with friends or family, telling the story of one's life, clinical applications for the memory impaired, and fundamental psychological investigations of memory.

Using this threshold, they observed, one could match the relevance criteria of users to those of judges used to develop a test collection, hence selected users should have a better search experience with systems judged superior on that collection. In this paper we show that, when the level of relevance of documents is measured using a categorical scale such as TREC relevance levels, rather than a numerical or physical scale, then the psychophysical techniques for determining thresholds cannot be meaningfully applied in some cases. We demonstrate that the choice of mapping from the categorical scale to a numerical scale has a marked effect on the thresholds derived. Instead, we propose a simpler methodology for matching users to judges.

In light of this, Robertson recently pointed out that AP can be interpreted as a special case of Normalised Cumulative Precision (NCP), computed as an expectation of precision over a population of users who eventually stop at different ranks in a list of retrieved documents. He regards AP as a crude version of NCP, in that the probability distribution of the user's stopping behaviour is uniform across all relevant documents. In this paper, we generalise NCP further and demonstrate that AP and its graded-relevance version Q-measure are in fact reasonable metrics despite the above uniform probability assumption. From a probabilistic perspective, these metrics emphasise long-tail users who tend to dig deep into the ranked list, and thereby achieve high reliability. We also demonstrate that one of our new metrics, called NCU gu,\u03b2=1 , maintains high correlation with AP and shows the highest discriminative power, i.e., the proportion of statistically significantly different system pairs given a confidence level, by utilising graded relevance in a novel way.

While we view the agreement with real users as the most important, this paper proposes to use the Worst-case Con dence interval Width (WCW) curves to supplement it in test-collection environments. WCW is the worst-case width of a con dence interval (CI) for the di erence between any two systems, given a topic set size. We argue that WCW curves are more useful than the swap method and discriminative power, since they provide a statistically well-founded overview of the comparison of measures over various topic set sizes, and visualise what levels of di erences across measures might be of practical importance. First, we prove that Sakai's ANOVA-based topic set size design tool can be used for discussing WCW instead of his CI-based tool that cannot handle large topic set sizes. We then provide some case studies of evaluating evaluation measures using WCW curves based on the ANOVA-based tool, using data from TREC and NTCIR.

For each of our 50 topics, pooled documents were independently judged by three assessors: two \"lancers\" and one Waseda University student. A lancer is a worker hired through a Japanese part time job matching website, where the hirer is required to rate the quality of the lancer's work upon task completion and therefore the lancer has a reputation to maintain. Nine lancers and ve students were hired in total; the hourly pay was the same for all assessors. On the whole, the inter-assessor agreement between two lancers is statistically signi cantly higher than that between a lancer and a student. We then compared the system rankings and statistical signi cance test results according to di erent qrels versions created by changing which asessors to rely on: overall, the outcomes do di er according to the qrels versions, and those that rely on multiple assessors have a higher discriminative power than those that rely on a single assessor. Furthermore, we consider removing topics with relatively low inter-assessor agreements from the original topic set: we thus rank systems using 27 high-agreement topics, a er removing 23 low-agreement topics. While the system ranking with the full topic set and that with the high-agreement set are statistically equivalent, the ranking with the high-agreement set and that with the low-agreement set are not. Moreover, the low-agreement set substantially underperforms the full and the high-agreement sets in terms of discriminative power. Hence, from a statistical point of view, our results suggest that a high-agreement topic set is more useful for nding concrete research conclusions than a low-agreement one.

For example, the value of a tweet for a given purpose may be judged by (say) ten assessors, and their ratings could be summed up to de ne its gain value for computing a graded-relevance evaluation measure. In the present study, we propose a simple variant of this approach, which takes into account the fact that some items receive unanimous ratings while others are more controversial. We generate simulated ratings based on a real social-media-based IR task data to examine the e ect of our unanimity-aware approach on the system ranking and on statistical signi cance. Our results show that incorporating unanimity can a ect statistical signicance test results even when its impact on the gain value is kept to a minimum. Moreover, since our simulated ratings do not consider the correlation present in the assessors' actual ratings, our experiments probably underestimate the e ect of introducing unanimity into evaluation. Hence, if researchers accept that unanimous votes should be valued more highly than controversial ones, then our proposed approach may be worth incorporating.

During the initial phase of the track, assessors rate points-of-interests in a source city (Philadelphia for TREC 2013) in terms of their own interests. These rankings are distributed to participating groups, who are given about a month to generate point-of-interest suggestions for fifty other target cities around the United States, with personalized suggestions generated for each assessor on the basis of their ratings for the source city. These suggestions are then returned for rating, with each assessor rating their personalized suggestions for one or two of the target cites. Effectiveness scores (e.g., precision at rank 5) are then computed from these ratings. Unlike traditional TREC tasks, such as adhoc retrieval, it is not possible to measure assessor agreement, since each assessor is rating each point-in-interest in terms of their own personal preferences. Instead, we measure assessor consistency, which we define as an assessor's tendency to rank systems in the same order as other assessors.

These methods are based on statistical techniques described by Nagata [15]. While Sakai [22] used variance estimates based on oneway ANOVA, Sakai [23] used the 95% percentile method proposed by Webber, Moffat and Zobel [38]. This paper reruns the experiments reported by Sakai [22, 23] using variance estimates based on two-way ANOVA [17], which turn out to be slightly larger than their one-way ANOVA counterparts and substantially larger than the percentile-based ones. If researchers should choose to \"err on the side of over-sampling\" as recommened by Ellis [10], the variance estimation method based on two-way ANOVA and the results reported in this paper are probably the ones researchers should adopt. We also establish empirical relationships between the two topic set size design methods, and discuss the balance between n and the pool depth pd using both methods.

Robertson's 2-Poisson model and Rocchio's formula, both of which are known to be effective, have been applied in the system. Characteristics of newspapers such as locational information were applied. We present our application of Fujita's method, where longer terms are used in retrieval by the system but de-emphasized relative to the emphasis on the shortest terms; this allows us to use both compound and single-word terms. The statistical test used in expanding queries through an automatic feedback process is described. The method gives us terms which have been statistically confirmed to be related to the top-ranked documents that were obtained in the first retrieval. We also used a numerical term QIDF, which is an IDF term for queries. It has a function to decrease the scores for stop words that occur in many queries. It can be very useful for foreign languages for which we cannot examine stop words. We participated in three tasks (Korean, Japanese, and English) of monolingual information retrieval at NTCIR 4.

Our system can be characterized by the structure analysis for both target claim and entire application. Based on the rhetorical structure, a claim is segmented into multiple components, each of which is used to produce an initial query. The structure of an application is used to enhance each query. The candidates of relevant documents are retrieved and ranked on a component-bycomponent basis. The final document list is obtained by integrating these documents lists.

These assumptions are often questioned, since almost everybody agrees that relevance and retrieval are matter of degree (three or more categories, if not a continuum). However, the standard practice in IR systems evaluation remains based on the use of precision and recall (and related measures), thus hindering IR development and evaluation. We recently questioned these assumptions, and proposed a new measure named ADM (Average Distance Measure), in order to pass from binary to continuous relevance and retrieval [21, 6]. In this paper we describe the idea on which ADM is based, a conceptual analysis of this new measure, and the results of a first experimental validation on TREC data, which feature 2-levels human relevance judgments and IR systems that rank the retrieved documents. Furthermore, we present some experimental results on NTCIR-3 data, which feature 4-levels human relevance judgments and IR systems that assign a numeric score to the retrieved documents. Both conceptual and experimental results show that ADM might be potentially adequate, provided that IR system designers take some care in system implementation.

Thus, our method employs information from multiple documents by adding the scores of the candidate answers extracted from the various documents. Because simply adding scores degrades the performance of questionanswering systems, we add scores with decreasing weights to reduce the negative effect of simple adding.

For summarizing multiple documents translated by a machine translator, we extract important sentences, and remove redundant sentences using an improved term-weighting method. It assigns weights to words, using syntactic information. According to the score of the extracted sentence, we choose sentences, and map them to Japanese sentences in original documents. Finally, we arrange Japanese sentences in chronological order, and report them as the result of our system. We submitted both a short and long type of summary, and the evaluation of our results is not good.

In this Topical Classification Task, we attempted to assess the effectiveness of automatic classification systems for retrieved documents from Web search engine systems from a viewpoint of topical relevance. Here we use the \"Topical Classification\" as a general term, and so various techniques, such as text categorization or document clustering, can be ways of creating classification of the documents. For the classification task we used a target data set comprising ranked lists of search result documents from 100-gigabyte document data, which were mainly gathered from the '.jp' domain. We carried out an evaluation of automatic classification systems on the basis of the information retrieval task. We applied several evaluation measures that are often used in information retrieval evaluation. We also proposed new evaluation measures considering the number of classes.

Passage retrieval was performed by a density-based ranking method based on importance of query terms occurred in the passage. Question classification and Named entity extraction were designed by the rule-based approach that uses lexico-semantic patterns, in which the Kadokawa thesaurus is basic semantic resource. Our QA system consisting of these basic components showed a weak performance in NTCIR-4, but obtained high performance in pure answer extraction.

The concept-base is a knowledge base of words, which expresses each word as an associated vector. The word vectors are computed based on word co-occurrence in a target document set. Therefore, the word vectors reflect target documents' characteristics. Each document in the target document set is expressed as a vector that is composed of vectors associated with words included in the document. The word vectors and document vectors are positioned in an identical vector space and the relevant degree of similarity between any two words and/or documents can be computed as a cosine coefficient of the two vectors. Taking advantage of this model, problems sections and solutions sections of patent documents are expressed as vectors, then, they are clustered and the label word for each cluster is chosen from words which give high cosine coefficient to the center of gravity of the cluster. A trial of generating patent maps for NTCIR-4 patent FS task topics using the system has been done. Comparing with humangenerated patent maps, the system provides fairly good accuracy of clustering of target patents but poor accuracy of cluster labeling.

It turns out that a regression model of which independent variables are \"quality\" of query translation and \"difficulty\" of the search in itself explains well variations of values of average precision by CLIR runs. The \"quality\" of translations was measured as a score assigned by a human assessor based on the degree to which each translation is coincident with the corresponding term in the Japanese topic that the task organizers provided, and the \"difficulty\" of the search was represented as a value of average precision by the run using the Japanese topic (i.e., monolingual run).

Researches and developments of such aspects have been increasing recently, however, comparative evaluations of such kinds of techniques has not been carried out so far. GeoTask focused on the technology that the system extracts geographic information from Web documents relevant to a given viewpoint. The aim of this workshop is to expedite and advance researches and developments of Geographic IR technologies for the Web, therefore we are going to build reusable test collection for evaluating various methods of Geographic IR for Web documents.

We confirmed that character-based indexing did not produce relatively good retrieval effectiveness. We have also experimented with three new pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) methods. These new methods were able to achieve slightly better performance compared with our original PRF method for short queries at the same time using only 60 expanded terms instead of 140 expanded terms, thereby reducing the retrieval time by about 30 percentage points. We have experimented with a novel reranking strategy, called title re-ranking. This strategy rewards documents which title terms match with the terms in the title query. Title re-ranking is able to improve the performance but it h urts the performance of long queries when PRF is used with it. For title queries, our best MAP achieved was 24.9% using both title re-ranking and PRF based on rigid relevance judgment. For long queries using our original PRF, our best MAP was 26.0%.

For CLIR, query expansion before and after translation can provide an opportunity to recover from translation gaps, reduce ambiguity, and enhance recall. Furthermore, for CLIR in unsegmented Asian languages, appropriate unit selection for translation, indexing, and retrieval plays a key role. In our NTCIR4 CLIR experiments, we compare the effectiveness of different unit selection strategies-words and subword units-and different stages-pre-and post-translation for query expansion. We find that for the very short queries with many untranslatable words in this test collection, both pre-and post-translation query expansion, independently and in conjunction, significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness for all unit selection strategies. We find, however, no significant differences across unit selection strategies for expansion in merged multilingual runs. However, more detailed per-language analysis finds significantly better effectiveness in Japanese when character-bigram units are employed for the identification of presumed relevant documents during query expansion and word and bigram units are chosen for expansion over approaches that use wordbased units to identify relevant documents.

Web documents are not always descriptive and accurate in content. In addition, a significant difference between the problems of Web search and traditional text search is the availability of hyperlinks between pages. A page on the Web might possibly be cited by or cite other pages. When evaluating a page, the neighborhood of the page might be a part of the input. In this paper, in addition to the explicit information unit (page content), a new information unit, a virtual document, is introduced in our systems, which is mainly organized by the associated anchor-text of in-bounds links to a page and also its title data. We analyzed the utility of virtual document for Web searching. Three searching function based on virtual document are proposed in our study: \u2022 We propose a way to weight query terms through term entropy in the virtual document collection space. \u2022 Ranking algorithms are configured to index virtual documents as separate queryable data and our system considers it an important indicator of page relevance in addition to the relevance score of practical Web documents. \u2022 Our system implements a modified version of link analysis which employs literal matching between information units of the NTCIR-4 Web data. The experiment results show: Our Web searching system that uses our proposed ranking function works well. The new information units, virtual documents, play an important role in improving information retrieval results. Query term weighting using term entropy on virtual document space is effective in improving searching results. The combination of evidence from actual documents and virtual documents can improve searching results beyond either information source alone. The Query-independent score, which is calculated by our proposed link analysis model, could also obtain modest improvements through our tentative re-ranking methods.

In previous research, PDDP (Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning) is a well-known clustering algorithm. PDDP algorithm employs top-down and unsupervised clustering based on the principal component analysis and splits documents into two sets using a plane perpendicular to the maximum principal direction passing through the centroid of the documents. However, in case that the distribution of documents is biased, this algorithm difficult to split into two subsets accurately. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that improved the separation of the two sets considerably. We give experimental results using our clustering algorithm on the NTCIR-4 Web task.

Ferrucci', 'Koichi Takeda'] [] NTCIR 2010.ntcir_workshop-2010.1 1584009137.0 On April 27, 2009, IBM unveiled the details of a project for building an advanced computing system that will be able to compete with humans at the game of Jeopardy! Computer systems that can directly and accurately answer peoples' questions over a broad domain of human knowledge have been envisioned by scientists and writers since the advent of computers themselves. Consider, for example, the computer on Star Trek-how it understands questions and quickly provides accurate, customized answers and can engage in a fluent information seeking dialog with the user. We call this technology open domain question answering and it has tremendous promise for impacting society and business. Applications in business intelligence, health care, customer support, enterprise knowledge management, social computing, science and government would all benefit from such technology. The Project Watson is addressing a grand challenge in Computer Science aimed at illustrating how the integration and advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), massively parallel computation and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) can advance open-domain automatic Question Answering to a point where it clearly and consistently rivals the best human performance. An exciting proof-point in this challenge is to develop a computer system that can successfully compete against top human players at the well-known Jeopardy! quiz show. Attaining champion-level performance at the game of Jeopardy! requires a computer system to rapidly and accurately answer challenging open-domain questions, and to predict its own performance on any given category/question. The system must deliver high degrees of precision and confidence over a very broad domain with a 3 second response time. It is highly unlikely that any system will be able to clearly justify all the answer with perfect certainty over such a broad range of natural language questions and content. Computing accurate confidences is an important requirement for determining when to \"buzz in\" against your competitors and how much to bet. While critical for winning the game, high precision and accurate confidence computations are just as critical for a QA system to provide real value in business settings. The need for speed and for very high precision demands a massively parallel compute platform capable of generating and evaluating 1000's of hypotheses and their associated evidence. In this talk we will introduce the audience to the Jeopardy! Challenge and describe our technical approach and progress on this grand-challenge problem.

The TREC 2009 Web Track included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task. The goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. Both tasks will continue at TREC 2010, which will also include a new Web spam task. The track uses the ClueWeb09 dataset as its document collection. This collection consists of roughly 1 billion web pages in multiple languages, comprising approximately 25TB of uncompressed data crawled from the general Web during ClueWeb09 and TREC Diversity"}
