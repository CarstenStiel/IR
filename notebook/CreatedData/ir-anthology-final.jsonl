The service generates feeds of recent papers that are specific and relevant to each user's scientific interests by leveraging state of the art embeddings and clustering techniques. Meta also calculates article-level inferred Eigenfactor\u00ae scores which are used to rank the papers. This paper discusses Meta's approach to query formulation and ranking to improve retrieval of recently published, and yet un-cited academic publications.

Much of this progress can be attributed to the vast amounts of textual data that have become available and to a concomitant weakening of theoretical commitments, so as to be able to use the data in information extraction, sentiment analysis, question answering, etc. Along with weakened commitments to the demands of particular theories, has been a greater willingness to consider what can be learned from textual data and from various forms of annotation, in English and in other languages as well. This paper briefly summarizes (1) changing assumptions about discourse structure; (2) recent work on lexico-syntactic grounding of low-level discourse structure and frameworks for higher-level discourse structure that recognize differences in genre; and (3) suggestions for addressing some of the challenges still facing us.

The choice of software may have a great influence not only on the research process but also on the derived findings, e.g. when errors in the used software lead to incorrect computations or biases. In order to increase transparency of research and verifiability of findings, knowledge of the used software thus is crucial. However, explicit links between publications and used software are usually not available. In addition, software is, unlike literature, often not cited in a standardized way which makes the automatic generation of links difficult. While recent Named Entity Recognition (NER) approaches yield excellent results for a wide range of use-cases and tasks, they typically require large sets of annotated data which may be hard to acquire. In this paper, we investigate the use of weakly supervised approaches with distant supervision to create silver labels to train supervised software mention extraction methods using transfer learning. We show that by combining even only a small number of weakly supervised approaches, a silver standard corpus can be created that serves as a useful basis for transfer learning.
