We propose a machine learning approach to learn the probability that a user may find a follow-up query both useful and relevant, given his initial query. Our approach is based on a machine learning model which enables us to generalize to queries that have never occurred in the logs as well. The model is trained on co-occurrences mined from the search logs, with novel utility and relevance models, and the machine learning step is done without any labeled data by human judges. The learning step allows us to generalize from the past observations and generate query suggestions that are beyond the past co-occurred queries.

We propose a machine learning approach to learn the probability that a user may find a follow-up query both useful and relevant, given his initial query. Our approach is based on a machine learning model which enables us to generalize to queries that have never occurred in the logs as well. The model is trained on co-occurrences mined from the search logs, with novel utility and relevance models, and the machine learning step is done without any labeled data by human judges. The learning step allows us to generalize from the past observations and generate query suggestions that are beyond the past co-occurred queries. This brings significant gains in coverage while yielding modest gains in relevance.

To alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF, social recommendation has emerged by leveraging social influence among users for better recommendation performance. In these systems, uses' preferences over time are determined by their temporal dynamic interests as well as the general static interests. In the meantime, the complex interplay between users' internal interests and the social influence from the social network drives the evolution of users' preferences over time. Nevertheless, traditional approaches either neglected the social network structure for temporal recommendation or assumed a static social influence strength for static social recommendation. Thus, the problem of how to leverage social influence to enhance temporal social recommendation performance remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we present an attentive recurrent network based approach for temporal social recommendation. In the proposed approach, we model users' complex dynamic and general static preferences over time by fusing social influence among users with two attention networks. Specifically, in the dynamic preference modeling process, we design a dynamic social aware recurrent neural network to capture users' complex latent interests over time, where a temporal attention network is proposed to learn the temporal social influence over time. In the general static preference modeling process, we characterize each user's static interest by introducing a static social attention network to model the stationary social influence among users. The output of the dynamic preferences and the static preferences are combined together in a unified end-to-end framework for the temporal social recommendation task.

In this work we suggest to select Web ranking functions according to both their relevance and robustness to the changes that may lead to relevance degradation over time. We argue that the ranking robustness can be effectively measured by taking into account the ranking score distribution across search results. We then propose two alternatives to the NDCG metric that both incorporate ranking robustness into ranking function evaluation and selection. A machine learning approach is developed to learn the parameters that control the metric sensitivity to score turbulence, from human-judged preference data.

Most of the recent works in social recommendation assume that people share similar preference with their socially connected friends. However, this assumption may not hold due to the diversity of social relations, and modeling social influence on users' preference may not be suitable for implicit feedback data (i.e. whether a user has consumed certain items). Since users often share item information with their social relations, it will be less restrictive to model social influence on users' exposure to items.

Can a classifier that is tuned to perform well on training datasets continue to filter out irrelevant pages in the face of changed content on the Web? We investigate this question in the context of researcher homepage crawling.We show experimentally that classifiers trained on existing datasets for homepage identification underperform while classifying \"irrelevant\" pages on current-day academic websites. As an alternative to obtaining datasets to retrain the classifier for the new content, we propose to use effectively unlimited amounts of unlabeled data readily available from these websites in a co-training scenario. To this end, we design novel URL-based features and use them in conjunction with content-based features as complementary views of the data to obtain remarkable improvements in accurately identifying homepages from the current-day university websites.In addition, we propose a novel technique for \"learning a conforming pair of classifiers\" using mini-batch gradient descent. Our algorithm seeks to minimize a loss (objective) function quantifying the difference in predictions from the two views afforded by co-training. We demonstrate that tuning the classifiers so that they make \"similar\" predictions on unlabeled data strongly corresponds to the effect achieved by co-training algorithms. We argue that this loss formulation provides insight into understanding the co-training process and can be used even in absence of a validation set.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nH.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Miscellaneous\nGeneral TermsAlgorithms Keywords co-training, consensus maximization, gradient descent\nMOTIVATIONProfessional homepages of researchers, which typically summarize research interests, publications and other metadata related to researchers, are shown to be rich sources of information for digital libraries .

ACM 978-1-4503-2035 (also referred to as academic homepages or simply homepages in this paper) have been successfully employed in tasks such as expertise search , extraction of academic networks, author profile extraction and disambiguation  as they provide crucial evidence for improving these tasks in digital libraries.Furthermore, digital library systems such as CiteSeer 1 , ArnetMiner 2 , and Google Scholar 3 are primarily interested in obtaining and tracking researchers' homepages in order to retrieve appropriate scientific research publications. Given the infeasibility of collecting the entire content on the Web, a focused crawler aims to minimize the use of network bandwidth and hardware by selectively crawling only pages relevant to a (specified) set of topics . A key component for such a crawler is a classification module that identifies whether a webpage being accessed during the crawl process is potentially useful to the collection. For digital libraries, the \"yield\" of such crawlers highly depends on the accuracy of researcher homepage classification.Supervised methods for learning homepage classifiers rely on the availability of large amounts of labeled data. A widely used labeled dataset for webpage classification is the WebKB dataset 4 that is built in 1997. However, due to recent changes in the information content on academic websites, this dataset is becoming outdated. For example, there are now pages on academic websites that are related to various activities such as invited talks, news, events that do not occur in the WebKB dataset. We refer to university, department and research center websites as \"academic websites\" in this paper. Compared to few decades back, it is easier now to find faculty information, links to their homepages, information on research groups, course related notes and documents, and research papers from academic websites. Similarly, job postings, seminar announcements and notices are also being uploaded onto departmental websites in recent times .How can a homepage classifier keep up in the face of rapidly changing types of pages on the Web? Specifically, given a classifier that identifies homepages with reasonable accuracy (as measured on the training datasets), how does it perform in the potentially different deployment environment? Semi-supervised methods that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with limited amounts of labeled data for learning accurate classifiers have received significant attention in recent research in machine learning due to Against this background, one question that can be raised is: Can we design techniques to effectively adjust the previouslytrained classifier to the changed content on the Web, while minimizing the human effort required for labeling new data, and under what conditions, can such an adjustment be possible? The research that we describe in this paper addresses specifically this question.Contributions and Organization. We present two approaches to researcher homepage classification using unlabeled data readily available from academic websites. More precisely, we first adapt the well-known co-training approach  to reflect the change in the data distribution over time. Second, we design an iterative algorithm based on the Minibatch Gradient Descent technique for learning a conforming pair of predictors using two different views of the data. We restrict ourselves to homepages of researchers in Computer Science since training datasets are available for this discipline. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of researcher homepage classification using unlabeled data available during focused crawling was not addressed in previous research. The contributions of this work are as follows:\u2022 We show that with the classifiers trained on existing datasets for researcher homepage classification we incorrectly identify pages of types not seen in the training datasets as homepages. This results in unacceptable yield from the perspective of a focused crawler.\u2022 We design novel features based on URL surface patterns and terms to complement term and HTML features extracted from the content of homepages and show that these two sets of features can be treated as two \"views\" for a researcher homepage instance.\u2022 We show that the URL and content-based views can be used successfully in a co-training setup to adapt classifiers to the changing academic environments using unlabeled data. This finding enables us to accurately crawl the new academic website content without having to label a new dataset for re-training the classifier.\u2022 Inspired by the success of co-training on this problem, we investigate loss functions that capture the disparity between the classifiers' predictions on the two views afforded by co-training. We design an iterative algorithm based on the Mini-batch Gradient Descent technique for minimizing this loss and learning a conforming pair of predictors with the two views.\u2022 Finally, we show that minimizing our proposed loss function on unlabeled data closely corresponds to the effect demonstrated by co-training techniques. We posit that this loss can, therefore, be used as a measure, for tracking the progress of co-training schemes even in the absence of a validation dataset.Although in this paper we focus on the design of accurate approaches for researcher homepage classification, our objective is to integrate this classification component in the context of focused crawling, to improve retrieval and indexing of scientific publications in digital libraries such as CiteSeer and ArnetMiner. In these usage environments, since maintaining up-to-date collections of research literature is of primary importance, having an accurate list of homepage URLs for frequent, periodic tracking is both feasible and scalable, compared to examining the entire content at academic websites each time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We briefly summarize closely related work in Section 2. Researcher homepage classification is discussed in Section 3. We elaborate on details of our co-training experiments and learning conforming predictor pairs in Section 4. Experimental setup, datasets and results are discussed in Section 5, followed by a summary and future extensions to our work.\nRELATED WORKResearcher homepage classification is a well-studied webpage classification problem in context of digital libraries such as CiteSeer  and ArnetMiner . Typically, contentbased term features and HTML structure-based features are used for classifying webpages . We propose the use of URL features as additional evidence for homepage identification. A smaller set (compared to ours) of URL-based features (presence of part of the name, presence of the character '\u223c', etc.), was used in isolating homepages among the search engine results for researcher name queries by Tang, et  al [40]. URL-based features are widely used in tasks related to the Web. For example, URL strings were used for extracting rules to solve the webpage de-duplication problem . Shih and Karger [38]  used URL features, the visual placements of links in the referring pages to a URL for improving applications such as ad-blocking and recommendation, whereas a preliminary study by Kan and Thi [20]  illustrates the use of URLs in performing fast webpage classification.The problem of collecting a high-quality researcher homepage collection was studied for Japanese websites by Wang, et al. using on-page and anchor text features . Tang, et al. studied homepage acquisition from search engine results using researcher names as queries . In contrast, we seek to apply focused crawling using a seed list of academic websites (where researcher homepages are typically hosted) to acquire such a collection. Focused crawling first proposed by Bra, et al. is a rich area of research on the Web . Chakrabarti, et al. [7]  present a discussion on the main components involved in building a focused crawler. Although focused crawling is our motivating application, this paper deals with the classifier component of the crawler and not with the crawler itself.We show that the focused crawling scenario presents novel challenges in using a pre-trained homepage classifier in identifying relevant pages. Specifically, the classifier needs to be attuned to the changing types of pages on the Web. Cotraining is proposed as a solution for addressing this challenge for homepage classification. Blum and Mitchell [4] first proposed co-training, an approach for semi-supervised learning when the number of labeled examples available for training is limited, and applied it to webpage classification. This approach requires having two views of features for the instances and has been shown to work well when the two views satisfy certain assumptions on \"sufficiency\" and \"independence\" . Recent research addresses techniques for decomposing the feature set into two views when such a split is not naturally available .Multiview learning (of which co-training is a special case, with two views) is typically addressed by maximizing \"consensus\" or agreement among the different views . Most solutions to multiview learning tend to frame the problem in terms of a global optimization problem and simulta-472 neously learn classifiers for all the underlying views. In some cases, the solutions depend on underlying classification algorithm used . Although our proposed algorithm based on mini-batch gradient descent seeks to maximize consensus as well, our approach is a generic technique assuming only that the underlying classifiers output initial \"parameter vectors\" that are altered using a simple, iterative algorithm.\nFEATURES FOR HOMEPAGE CLASSIFICATIONWebpage or text classification is typically handled using \"bag of words\" approaches. Specifically, the frequently occurring and discerning terms are collected from training data to form a feature dictionary that is used to represent instances as normalized term frequency or TFIDF vectors . Homepage classification was previously studied as a text classification problem using term features . Previous work on the same problem also used other content-based features related to the HTML structure of the page such as the number of images/tables on the page, and the terms commonly found in anchor text of homepages . In this study, we extracted content-based and URL-based features from our training sets. These features and the size of feature sets are summarized in . The term dictionaries contain terms that occur in at least three documents (i.e., webpages) and at least five times in the training set.In addition to term dictionaries, we hypothesize that the URL strings of homepages can provide additional evidence for identifying homepages. Hence, we design novel URLbased features based on surface patterns and presence in WordNet 5 . The URL-based features are explained in the next subsection.  \nURL strings as additional evidenceThe idea of using URL strings in academic homepage identification comes from an error analysis of a crawl obtained with the content-based classifier. Consider some example URLs we encountered in our crawl listed in .With some knowledge in academic browsing, one can confidently guess that the webpages at the URLs (1), (2), and (3) are unlikely to be researcher homepages. Similarly, among the URLs (4), and (5), while the former seems to be a homepage, the latter seems to lead to a course page. The above conjectures are based on the presumption that the URL strings are not \"arbitrary\", but, instead conventions are observed that are indicative of the target content at the URL. For instance, in the previous examples, words such as \"projects\", \"events\", alphanumeric patterns of the terms in the URL indicate that the URLs, (1), (2), (3) and (5) are most possibly not researcher homepages.Treating \"/\" as delimiters, we extract features from the URL string following the domain name of a webpage. The list of all unigrams and bigrams from URL strings that occur more than thrice in the training dataset, comprise the URL-term dictionary. For terms in the URL not present in this dictionary, we look for their presence in WordNet to check if they are common words or proper nouns. WordNet is a large, lexical database of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs for English, organized as a concept graph .In addition, we capture the surface patterns of the URLs including the presence of hyphenated or underscored words, alphanumeric patterns, long words (i.e., words having greater than 30 characters), question marks and the presence of characters such as tilde. These features are designed to filter out the URLs that commonly represent course pages, announcements, calendars and other auto-generated content. For instance, a typical homepage URL string in Computer Science departments has the name of the researcher following the \u223c character after the domain name (e.g., http://people.cs.umass.edu/\u223cmccallum/). This pattern is usually captured by our \"TILDENONDICT\" feature, where mccallum is a non-dictionary term. Partial sets of extracted features are shown along with the URLs listed in .The above sets of features perform very well on the training datasets as shown Section 5. We, therefore, do not study other complicated, problem-specific feature design or feature selection. Instead our focus in this work is to study how these classifiers perform \"in the wild\". We also note here that, a classifier that can make accurate predictions using URL features can be quite beneficial from the perspective of efficiency for a focused crawler. A crawler can potentially bypass examining the content of a page if a confident decision can be made based on the URL string. However, we may not be able to always extract features from the URL strings. For instance, consider the following URLs from our crawls:http://john.blitzer.com/ http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/ http://ben.adida.net/ In these cases, it is not clear from the URL string that the target content refers to academic homepages. Even if complicated name-extraction based features were designed for the above cases, it is rare to find academic homepages with '.com' and '.net' domain suffixes. Based on the URL alone, we cannot be confident if the target content is an academic homepage or a company/personal homepage. For the second case, 'clgiles' could refer to a machine name. In addition to the above cases, given that feature dictionaries typically comprise features that meet a frequency requirement, we may not be able to extract features for all URLs. In our training datasets (Section 5), we were unable to extract URL features for about 27% of the instances. Therefore, contentbased and URL features complement each other while identifying homepage instances and a focused crawler might be required to use either or both of these sets of features.\nHOMEPAGE CLASSIFICATION USING UNLABELED DATAWe show in our experiments (Section 5) that, although content-based features perform extremely well on the training datasets, they are not very successful on the validation and test sets that were collected from the current-day academic websites. On the other hand, URL features show good performance on both training and validation datasets.  However, as pointed out in the previous section, we may not be able to extract URL features for all instances and it is, therefore, imperative to have an accurate content-based classifier as well. We now address the questions: Can we adapt the contentbased classifier to perform well in the deployment environment with the help of the URL-based classifier? Can the two classifiers \"teach\" each other so as to perform better in the new environment, using the co-training approach? Since the URL and content features provide evidence for classifying a webpage instance independently, intuitively, it appears possible that there are instances that the URL classifier makes mistakes on, which the content-based classifier identifies correctly and vice versa.Blum and Mitchell proposed co-training in context of webpage classification . In their datasets, webpages are representable in terms of two distinct views: using terms on webpages and terms in the anchor text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages. When few labeled examples are available for training, they showed that co-training could be used to obtain predictions on the unlabeled data to enlarge the training set. Blum and Mitchell's experiments and the subsequent experiments by Nigam and Ghani  showed that when a natural split of features is available, co-training that explicitly leverages this split has the potential to outperform classifiers that do not.We study the applicability and extension of co-training for our problem. Although the essential motivation is to make use of the naturally available feature split and enable classifiers to learn from each other, we highlight the following aspects of our setup: Previous studies and benefits from co-training were illustrated on datasets where the unlabeled data is arguably from a similar distribution. That is, the positive and negative instances in the labeled datasets are representative of those in the unlabeled data. This is in contrast to our case, where our positive class is fairly welldefined (homepages), whereas the negative class is described in terms of \"not positive\". More precisely, although our training dataset has examples for the negative class, webpages encountered during the crawls can belong to types not encountered in the labeled data. We present an error analysis in Section 5, that illustrates the \"new\" types of webpages encountered in our crawl, potentially causing the pre-trained content-based classifiers to underperform during crawling.The number of negative instances encountered during our crawls is higher in comparison with the number of positive instances. While this aspect was noticed during our experiments, a previous estimation experiment using markrecapture methods had indicated that academic homepages comprise a minute fraction of the Web . We can expect this imbalance to become more prominent as more examples are sampled over the co-training rounds. In the algorithm studied by Blum and Mitchell, the ratio between the number of positive and negative instances added from the unlabeled data is maintained to be the same as that in the training dataset during each iteration of co-training . We argue that avoiding this constraint is better in our scenario since we want the datasets to be more representative of the changing distribution.Most classification algorithms are sensitive to the number of positive and negative instances available in the training data and are known to learn biased classifiers in case of severe imbalance . We employ the idea of altering the mis-classification costs for the underlying classifiers during each round of co-training to handle this problem. For example, if the training dataset has 10 positive and 100 negative instances, we can set the penalty incurred on making mistakes on a negative instance to be 1 10 th of the penalty incurred on making mistakes on a positive instance. For most implementations of classification algorithms, the misclassification costs can be specified as a parameter during the training process .Our co-training setup is detailed in Algorithm 1. L and U represent the labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively, available at each iteration. They comprise instances with both the views (content-based and URL-based feature sets). For a round of co-training, we train classifiers, C1 and C2, on the two available views, using misclassification costs, \u03c11 and \u03c12, respectively. Next, \"s\" number of examples are sampled without replacement into S from the unlabeled data and C1 and C2 are used to obtain predictions for these instances. The GetConf identEgs method is a generic placeholder that stands for a function that determines what instances from S are chosen for addition in subsequent rounds of co-training. We use the notation L + 1 to represent the positive instances in the set L1 whereas L 1 1 indicates that the view 1 (or feature set 1) of the examples in L1 is being used.Based on previous studies in co-training , we studied the following strategies for this function:\u2022 AddBoth: In this scheme, we add all examples from S that are labeled by C1 or C2 confidently to the training set for the next round. This approach is similar to selftraining used in semi-supervised learning where confidently predicted unlabeled instances are added to the training set for retraining the classifier in subsequent rounds . However, in contrast with self-training that uses a single view, in AddBoth, confident predictions are obtained from two sources (view 1 and 2) for addition into subsequent rounds.\u2022 AddCross: In this scheme, examples from S, confidently labeled by C1 are added to view 2 for the next 474 round and vice versa. That is, we use the examples confidently labeled by one classifier while training the other classifier in the next round. Cross-addition also seems resilient to handling the possibility of cascaded errors over the iterations. If a classifier makes a confident but incorrect prediction, we would like to avoid feeding this example in the next round to the same classifier, a common problem in self-training [45].\u2022 AddCrossRC: This scheme is similar to AddCross with the additional constraint on the number of positive and negative instances added in each round. This constraint was originally studied by Blum and Mitchell and ensures that the ratio of the number of positive and negative instances added in each round is the same as that in the initial labeled dataset .Algorithm 1 Procedure for Co-trainingCompute \u03c1 1 usingThe co-training algorithm is general and can be applied with any choice of classifiers on the two views. Blum and Mitchell provided a PAC-style analysis of co-training with probabilistic classifiers and showed that co-training works when the assumptions on sufficiency and independence are met. That is, each view should be sufficient to predict the class label, and the two views are independent given the class label. Recent studies have proposed relaxed criteria under which co-training techniques still work . However, in practice, it is tricky to judge if co-training works for a problem and to verify if the assumptions are satisfied . These questions are more relevant in context of recent research in obtaining two views from a single view when two views are not naturally available for applying co-training . With this context, we now discuss our formulation of the effect obtained with co-training, in terms of a loss function. This formulation allows us to track whether the co-training process is beneficial for a given problem, even without the use of a validation dataset.\nLearning Conforming Predictors on Unlabeled DataWe assume that classifiers, C1 and C2 trained on the two views are parameterized in terms of their weight vectors, w1 and w2. Most classification algorithms e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), output weight vectors capturing the importance of each feature as part of the training process .One can expect co-training to benefit a classification problem if one classifier (say, C1) can \"guide\" the other (C2) on examples that the latter makes mistakes on. This guidance is provided by adding examples confidently labeled by C1 to the subsequent round of training C2. This observation hints at the possibility of directly manipulating C2, based on C1's prediction for an example that C2 is not confident about. This effect can be achieved by optimizing a function that directly captures the mismatch in the predictions of the two classifiers.Elaborating further, given that the concept classes, \"positive\" and \"negative\" are still the same on unlabeled data, if C1 and C2 are accurate, they would make similar predictions on the unlabeled data. This intuition is the basis for \"consensus maximization\" widely adopted in multiview learning, of which co-training is a special case with two views . The mismatch in predictions by C1 and C2 on unlabeled data can be quantified using a loss function. The squared error loss function commonly used in machine learning captures this loss as:The above formulation captures the average squared-difference in predictions from the two views on unlabeled data. w1 and w2 correspond to the parameter vectors corresponding to C1 and C2, respectively, and u refers to an example from U , having two views, u1 and u2. For a given example, u = (u1, u2), the functions, f1 and f2 act on u1 and u2 respectively, and make the predictions from C1 and C2 comparable. These functions could be generic (e.g. a function that outputs the probability that the instance is positive) or classifier-dependent (for e.g. a function that outputs scaled distances from the separating hyperplane in case of Support Vector Machines). Minimizing L corresponds to adjusting the weight vectors, w1 and w2, so that they make similar predictions on U . In contrast with multiview learning methods, where learning the classifiers is folded into a global objective function in sophisticated ways , we adopt a simpler approach that works off the initial parameter vectors and iteratively modifies them in a \"co-training like\" manner. Note that this initialization plays a crucial role in avoiding trivial solutions (such as w1, w2 = 0) that are potentially possible since the loss is optimized only on unlabeled instances. Our proposed technique for obtaining the \"pair of conforming classifiers\" is described in Algorithm 2.In Algorithm 2, we start with the original parameter vectors w1 and w2 from classifiers C1 and C2, respectively, and iteratively adjust these vectors so that the values of f1(w1, u1) and f2(w2, u2) look similar for all u \u2208 U . The input parameter, #oIters, refers to the number of times the inner loop comprising of the two gradient descent steps is executed, where as, the #iIters, and \u03b1 are parameters for the gradient descent algorithm. Overall, the values of #oIters, #iIters, and \u03b1 control the rate of convergence of the algorithm and can be set experimentally. These parameters can be set based on the base classifiers used, noting when the decrease in the objective function value is below a threshold. Adaptive tuning of these parameters by tracking the change in the value of the objective function in every iteration is a subject for future study .In each iteration, we employ mini-batch gradient descent to minimize the loss function, once w.r.t. w1 and next w.r.t. w2. The mini-batch gradient descent algorithm is a hybrid approach often used for large-scale machine learning problems. This approach combines the best of stochastic (on- line) gradient descent and batch gradient descent to obtain fast convergence during optimization by running gradient descent on small batches of randomly selected examples .In our algorithm, in each iteration, a small batch of instances are randomly sampled from the unlabeled data, U and the loss function defined using instances for which w1 makes confident predictions from this sampled set. This loss is minimized using gradient descent to adjust w2. A similar process is then applied for adjusting w1 using confident predictions from w2. In effect, as the algorithm proceeds, we are adjusting the parameters of each classifier so that it makes predictions that are aligned with those of the other classifier's confident predictions. Upon convergence, both w1 and w2 are adjusted so that they make conforming predictions on the unlabeled data.In our experiments, we used the differentiable, logistic sigmoid function for f1 and f2. Typically, classifiers use the parameter vector, w, for computing decision values for each instance. That is, given an instance x, the dot product value, w, x , is used for determining the label assignment for the instance. This value can be 'squashed' to a number between 0 and 1 indicating that the probability that instance has a particular label with the logistic function [3]: P (t) = 1 1 + e \u2212t with dP (t) dt = P (t) \u00b7 (1 \u2212 P (t)) Given, the simple form for the derivative, we can directly use the values of f1 and f2 (that we compute anyway), for computing the gradients in Algorithm 2. Although the effect obtained by Algorithm 2 is similar to that of co-training, the conformity loss directly measures the effect of co-training as it is being applied. In contrast, Algorithm 1 is typically terminated either when no more examples are available or by tracking the performance on a validation dataset.We provide a preliminary, experimental demonstration of the connection between co-training and our proposed algorithm in Section 5. A more detailed analysis, study of other choices for the loss function L and the functions, f1 and f2, are a subject of future work. Nevertheless, quantifying the discrepancy in predictions from the two views and an algorithm to directly address this aspect is an exciting step in understanding when co-training works. We show in Section 5 that our method can be used in lieu of a validation dataset for tracking the performance of co-training.\nEXPERIMENTSWe discuss 3 types of experiments: First, we study the performance of content-based and URL-based features on the training and validation datasets. Second, we show that co-training can successfully address the problem of mismatch in the training and deployment environments for homepage classification. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 2), achieves the same effect as co-training.

Can a classifier that is tuned to perform well on training datasets continue to filter out irrelevant pages in the face of changed content on the Web? We investigate this question in the context of researcher homepage crawling.We show experimentally that classifiers trained on existing datasets for homepage identification underperform while classifying \"irrelevant\" pages on current-day academic websites. As an alternative to obtaining datasets to retrain the classifier for the new content, we propose to use effectively unlimited amounts of unlabeled data readily available from these websites in a co-training scenario. To this end, we design novel URL-based features and use them in conjunction with content-based features as complementary views of the data to obtain remarkable improvements in accurately identifying homepages from the current-day university websites.In addition, we propose a novel technique for \"learning a conforming pair of classifiers\" using mini-batch gradient descent. Our algorithm seeks to minimize a loss (objective) function quantifying the difference in predictions from the two views afforded by co-training. We demonstrate that tuning the classifiers so that they make \"similar\" predictions on unlabeled data strongly corresponds to the effect achieved by co-training algorithms. We argue that this loss formulation provides insight into understanding the co-training process and can be used even in absence of a validation set.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nH.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Miscellaneous\nGeneral TermsAlgorithms Keywords co-training, consensus maximization, gradient descent\nMOTIVATIONProfessional homepages of researchers, which typically summarize research interests, publications and other metadata related to researchers, are shown to be rich sources of information for digital libraries .

ACM 978-1-4503-2035 (also referred to as academic homepages or simply homepages in this paper) have been successfully employed in tasks such as expertise search , extraction of academic networks, author profile extraction and disambiguation  as they provide crucial evidence for improving these tasks in digital libraries.Furthermore, digital library systems such as CiteSeer 1 , ArnetMiner 2 , and Google Scholar 3 are primarily interested in obtaining and tracking researchers' homepages in order to retrieve appropriate scientific research publications. Given the infeasibility of collecting the entire content on the Web, a focused crawler aims to minimize the use of network bandwidth and hardware by selectively crawling only pages relevant to a (specified) set of topics . A key component for such a crawler is a classification module that identifies whether a webpage being accessed during the crawl process is potentially useful to the collection. For digital libraries, the \"yield\" of such crawlers highly depends on the accuracy of researcher homepage classification.Supervised methods for learning homepage classifiers rely on the availability of large amounts of labeled data. A widely used labeled dataset for webpage classification is the WebKB dataset 4 that is built in 1997. However, due to recent changes in the information content on academic websites, this dataset is becoming outdated. For example, there are now pages on academic websites that are related to various activities such as invited talks, news, events that do not occur in the WebKB dataset. We refer to university, department and research center websites as \"academic websites\" in this paper. Compared to few decades back, it is easier now to find faculty information, links to their homepages, information on research groups, course related notes and documents, and research papers from academic websites. Similarly, job postings, seminar announcements and notices are also being uploaded onto departmental websites in recent times .How can a homepage classifier keep up in the face of rapidly changing types of pages on the Web? Specifically, given a classifier that identifies homepages with reasonable accuracy (as measured on the training datasets), how does it perform in the potentially different deployment environment? Semi-supervised methods that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with limited amounts of labeled data for learning accurate classifiers have received significant attention in recent research in machine learning due to Against this background, one question that can be raised is: Can we design techniques to effectively adjust the previouslytrained classifier to the changed content on the Web, while minimizing the human effort required for labeling new data, and under what conditions, can such an adjustment be possible? The research that we describe in this paper addresses specifically this question.Contributions and Organization. We present two approaches to researcher homepage classification using unlabeled data readily available from academic websites. More precisely, we first adapt the well-known co-training approach  to reflect the change in the data distribution over time. Second, we design an iterative algorithm based on the Minibatch Gradient Descent technique for learning a conforming pair of predictors using two different views of the data. We restrict ourselves to homepages of researchers in Computer Science since training datasets are available for this discipline. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of researcher homepage classification using unlabeled data available during focused crawling was not addressed in previous research. The contributions of this work are as follows:\u2022 We show that with the classifiers trained on existing datasets for researcher homepage classification we incorrectly identify pages of types not seen in the training datasets as homepages. This results in unacceptable yield from the perspective of a focused crawler.\u2022 We design novel features based on URL surface patterns and terms to complement term and HTML features extracted from the content of homepages and show that these two sets of features can be treated as two \"views\" for a researcher homepage instance.\u2022 We show that the URL and content-based views can be used successfully in a co-training setup to adapt classifiers to the changing academic environments using unlabeled data. This finding enables us to accurately crawl the new academic website content without having to label a new dataset for re-training the classifier.\u2022 Inspired by the success of co-training on this problem, we investigate loss functions that capture the disparity between the classifiers' predictions on the two views afforded by co-training. We design an iterative algorithm based on the Mini-batch Gradient Descent technique for minimizing this loss and learning a conforming pair of predictors with the two views.\u2022 Finally, we show that minimizing our proposed loss function on unlabeled data closely corresponds to the effect demonstrated by co-training techniques. We posit that this loss can, therefore, be used as a measure, for tracking the progress of co-training schemes even in the absence of a validation dataset.Although in this paper we focus on the design of accurate approaches for researcher homepage classification, our objective is to integrate this classification component in the context of focused crawling, to improve retrieval and indexing of scientific publications in digital libraries such as CiteSeer and ArnetMiner. In these usage environments, since maintaining up-to-date collections of research literature is of primary importance, having an accurate list of homepage URLs for frequent, periodic tracking is both feasible and scalable, compared to examining the entire content at academic websites each time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We briefly summarize closely related work in Section 2. Researcher homepage classification is discussed in Section 3. We elaborate on details of our co-training experiments and learning conforming predictor pairs in Section 4. Experimental setup, datasets and results are discussed in Section 5, followed by a summary and future extensions to our work.\nRELATED WORKResearcher homepage classification is a well-studied webpage classification problem in context of digital libraries such as CiteSeer  and ArnetMiner . Typically, contentbased term features and HTML structure-based features are used for classifying webpages . We propose the use of URL features as additional evidence for homepage identification. A smaller set (compared to ours) of URL-based features (presence of part of the name, presence of the character '\u223c', etc.), was used in isolating homepages among the search engine results for researcher name queries by Tang, et  al [40]. URL-based features are widely used in tasks related to the Web. For example, URL strings were used for extracting rules to solve the webpage de-duplication problem . Shih and Karger [38]  used URL features, the visual placements of links in the referring pages to a URL for improving applications such as ad-blocking and recommendation, whereas a preliminary study by Kan and Thi [20]  illustrates the use of URLs in performing fast webpage classification.The problem of collecting a high-quality researcher homepage collection was studied for Japanese websites by Wang, et al. using on-page and anchor text features . Tang, et al. studied homepage acquisition from search engine results using researcher names as queries . In contrast, we seek to apply focused crawling using a seed list of academic websites (where researcher homepages are typically hosted) to acquire such a collection. Focused crawling first proposed by Bra, et al. is a rich area of research on the Web . Chakrabarti, et al. [7]  present a discussion on the main components involved in building a focused crawler. Although focused crawling is our motivating application, this paper deals with the classifier component of the crawler and not with the crawler itself.We show that the focused crawling scenario presents novel challenges in using a pre-trained homepage classifier in identifying relevant pages. Specifically, the classifier needs to be attuned to the changing types of pages on the Web. Cotraining is proposed as a solution for addressing this challenge for homepage classification. Blum and Mitchell [4] first proposed co-training, an approach for semi-supervised learning when the number of labeled examples available for training is limited, and applied it to webpage classification. This approach requires having two views of features for the instances and has been shown to work well when the two views satisfy certain assumptions on \"sufficiency\" and \"independence\" . Recent research addresses techniques for decomposing the feature set into two views when such a split is not naturally available .Multiview learning (of which co-training is a special case, with two views) is typically addressed by maximizing \"consensus\" or agreement among the different views . Most solutions to multiview learning tend to frame the problem in terms of a global optimization problem and simulta-472 neously learn classifiers for all the underlying views. In some cases, the solutions depend on underlying classification algorithm used . Although our proposed algorithm based on mini-batch gradient descent seeks to maximize consensus as well, our approach is a generic technique assuming only that the underlying classifiers output initial \"parameter vectors\" that are altered using a simple, iterative algorithm.\nFEATURES FOR HOMEPAGE CLASSIFICATIONWebpage or text classification is typically handled using \"bag of words\" approaches. Specifically, the frequently occurring and discerning terms are collected from training data to form a feature dictionary that is used to represent instances as normalized term frequency or TFIDF vectors . Homepage classification was previously studied as a text classification problem using term features . Previous work on the same problem also used other content-based features related to the HTML structure of the page such as the number of images/tables on the page, and the terms commonly found in anchor text of homepages . In this study, we extracted content-based and URL-based features from our training sets. These features and the size of feature sets are summarized in . The term dictionaries contain terms that occur in at least three documents (i.e., webpages) and at least five times in the training set.In addition to term dictionaries, we hypothesize that the URL strings of homepages can provide additional evidence for identifying homepages. Hence, we design novel URLbased features based on surface patterns and presence in WordNet 5 . The URL-based features are explained in the next subsection.  \nURL strings as additional evidenceThe idea of using URL strings in academic homepage identification comes from an error analysis of a crawl obtained with the content-based classifier. Consider some example URLs we encountered in our crawl listed in .With some knowledge in academic browsing, one can confidently guess that the webpages at the URLs (1), (2), and (3) are unlikely to be researcher homepages. Similarly, among the URLs (4), and (5), while the former seems to be a homepage, the latter seems to lead to a course page. The above conjectures are based on the presumption that the URL strings are not \"arbitrary\", but, instead conventions are observed that are indicative of the target content at the URL. For instance, in the previous examples, words such as \"projects\", \"events\", alphanumeric patterns of the terms in the URL indicate that the URLs, (1), (2), (3) and (5) are most possibly not researcher homepages.Treating \"/\" as delimiters, we extract features from the URL string following the domain name of a webpage. The list of all unigrams and bigrams from URL strings that occur more than thrice in the training dataset, comprise the URL-term dictionary. For terms in the URL not present in this dictionary, we look for their presence in WordNet to check if they are common words or proper nouns. WordNet is a large, lexical database of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs for English, organized as a concept graph .In addition, we capture the surface patterns of the URLs including the presence of hyphenated or underscored words, alphanumeric patterns, long words (i.e., words having greater than 30 characters), question marks and the presence of characters such as tilde. These features are designed to filter out the URLs that commonly represent course pages, announcements, calendars and other auto-generated content. For instance, a typical homepage URL string in Computer Science departments has the name of the researcher following the \u223c character after the domain name (e.g., http://people.cs.umass.edu/\u223cmccallum/). This pattern is usually captured by our \"TILDENONDICT\" feature, where mccallum is a non-dictionary term. Partial sets of extracted features are shown along with the URLs listed in .The above sets of features perform very well on the training datasets as shown Section 5. We, therefore, do not study other complicated, problem-specific feature design or feature selection. Instead our focus in this work is to study how these classifiers perform \"in the wild\". We also note here that, a classifier that can make accurate predictions using URL features can be quite beneficial from the perspective of efficiency for a focused crawler. A crawler can potentially bypass examining the content of a page if a confident decision can be made based on the URL string. However, we may not be able to always extract features from the URL strings. For instance, consider the following URLs from our crawls:http://john.blitzer.com/ http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/ http://ben.adida.net/ In these cases, it is not clear from the URL string that the target content refers to academic homepages. Even if complicated name-extraction based features were designed for the above cases, it is rare to find academic homepages with '.com' and '.net' domain suffixes. Based on the URL alone, we cannot be confident if the target content is an academic homepage or a company/personal homepage. For the second case, 'clgiles' could refer to a machine name. In addition to the above cases, given that feature dictionaries typically comprise features that meet a frequency requirement, we may not be able to extract features for all URLs. In our training datasets (Section 5), we were unable to extract URL features for about 27% of the instances. Therefore, contentbased and URL features complement each other while identifying homepage instances and a focused crawler might be required to use either or both of these sets of features.\nHOMEPAGE CLASSIFICATION USING UNLABELED DATAWe show in our experiments (Section 5) that, although content-based features perform extremely well on the training datasets, they are not very successful on the validation and test sets that were collected from the current-day academic websites. On the other hand, URL features show good performance on both training and validation datasets.  However, as pointed out in the previous section, we may not be able to extract URL features for all instances and it is, therefore, imperative to have an accurate content-based classifier as well. We now address the questions: Can we adapt the contentbased classifier to perform well in the deployment environment with the help of the URL-based classifier? Can the two classifiers \"teach\" each other so as to perform better in the new environment, using the co-training approach? Since the URL and content features provide evidence for classifying a webpage instance independently, intuitively, it appears possible that there are instances that the URL classifier makes mistakes on, which the content-based classifier identifies correctly and vice versa.Blum and Mitchell proposed co-training in context of webpage classification . In their datasets, webpages are representable in terms of two distinct views: using terms on webpages and terms in the anchor text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages. When few labeled examples are available for training, they showed that co-training could be used to obtain predictions on the unlabeled data to enlarge the training set. Blum and Mitchell's experiments and the subsequent experiments by Nigam and Ghani  showed that when a natural split of features is available, co-training that explicitly leverages this split has the potential to outperform classifiers that do not.We study the applicability and extension of co-training for our problem. Although the essential motivation is to make use of the naturally available feature split and enable classifiers to learn from each other, we highlight the following aspects of our setup: Previous studies and benefits from co-training were illustrated on datasets where the unlabeled data is arguably from a similar distribution. That is, the positive and negative instances in the labeled datasets are representative of those in the unlabeled data. This is in contrast to our case, where our positive class is fairly welldefined (homepages), whereas the negative class is described in terms of \"not positive\". More precisely, although our training dataset has examples for the negative class, webpages encountered during the crawls can belong to types not encountered in the labeled data. We present an error analysis in Section 5, that illustrates the \"new\" types of webpages encountered in our crawl, potentially causing the pre-trained content-based classifiers to underperform during crawling.The number of negative instances encountered during our crawls is higher in comparison with the number of positive instances. While this aspect was noticed during our experiments, a previous estimation experiment using markrecapture methods had indicated that academic homepages comprise a minute fraction of the Web . We can expect this imbalance to become more prominent as more examples are sampled over the co-training rounds. In the algorithm studied by Blum and Mitchell, the ratio between the number of positive and negative instances added from the unlabeled data is maintained to be the same as that in the training dataset during each iteration of co-training . We argue that avoiding this constraint is better in our scenario since we want the datasets to be more representative of the changing distribution.Most classification algorithms are sensitive to the number of positive and negative instances available in the training data and are known to learn biased classifiers in case of severe imbalance . We employ the idea of altering the mis-classification costs for the underlying classifiers during each round of co-training to handle this problem. For example, if the training dataset has 10 positive and 100 negative instances, we can set the penalty incurred on making mistakes on a negative instance to be 1 10 th of the penalty incurred on making mistakes on a positive instance. For most implementations of classification algorithms, the misclassification costs can be specified as a parameter during the training process .Our co-training setup is detailed in Algorithm 1. L and U represent the labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively, available at each iteration. They comprise instances with both the views (content-based and URL-based feature sets). For a round of co-training, we train classifiers, C1 and C2, on the two available views, using misclassification costs, \u03c11 and \u03c12, respectively. Next, \"s\" number of examples are sampled without replacement into S from the unlabeled data and C1 and C2 are used to obtain predictions for these instances. The GetConf identEgs method is a generic placeholder that stands for a function that determines what instances from S are chosen for addition in subsequent rounds of co-training. We use the notation L + 1 to represent the positive instances in the set L1 whereas L 1 1 indicates that the view 1 (or feature set 1) of the examples in L1 is being used.Based on previous studies in co-training , we studied the following strategies for this function:\u2022 AddBoth: In this scheme, we add all examples from S that are labeled by C1 or C2 confidently to the training set for the next round. This approach is similar to selftraining used in semi-supervised learning where confidently predicted unlabeled instances are added to the training set for retraining the classifier in subsequent rounds . However, in contrast with self-training that uses a single view, in AddBoth, confident predictions are obtained from two sources (view 1 and 2) for addition into subsequent rounds.\u2022 AddCross: In this scheme, examples from S, confidently labeled by C1 are added to view 2 for the next 474 round and vice versa. That is, we use the examples confidently labeled by one classifier while training the other classifier in the next round. Cross-addition also seems resilient to handling the possibility of cascaded errors over the iterations. If a classifier makes a confident but incorrect prediction, we would like to avoid feeding this example in the next round to the same classifier, a common problem in self-training [45].\u2022 AddCrossRC: This scheme is similar to AddCross with the additional constraint on the number of positive and negative instances added in each round. This constraint was originally studied by Blum and Mitchell and ensures that the ratio of the number of positive and negative instances added in each round is the same as that in the initial labeled dataset .Algorithm 1 Procedure for Co-trainingCompute \u03c1 1 usingThe co-training algorithm is general and can be applied with any choice of classifiers on the two views. Blum and Mitchell provided a PAC-style analysis of co-training with probabilistic classifiers and showed that co-training works when the assumptions on sufficiency and independence are met. That is, each view should be sufficient to predict the class label, and the two views are independent given the class label. Recent studies have proposed relaxed criteria under which co-training techniques still work . However, in practice, it is tricky to judge if co-training works for a problem and to verify if the assumptions are satisfied . These questions are more relevant in context of recent research in obtaining two views from a single view when two views are not naturally available for applying co-training . With this context, we now discuss our formulation of the effect obtained with co-training, in terms of a loss function. This formulation allows us to track whether the co-training process is beneficial for a given problem, even without the use of a validation dataset.\nLearning Conforming Predictors on Unlabeled DataWe assume that classifiers, C1 and C2 trained on the two views are parameterized in terms of their weight vectors, w1 and w2. Most classification algorithms e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), output weight vectors capturing the importance of each feature as part of the training process .One can expect co-training to benefit a classification problem if one classifier (say, C1) can \"guide\" the other (C2) on examples that the latter makes mistakes on. This guidance is provided by adding examples confidently labeled by C1 to the subsequent round of training C2. This observation hints at the possibility of directly manipulating C2, based on C1's prediction for an example that C2 is not confident about. This effect can be achieved by optimizing a function that directly captures the mismatch in the predictions of the two classifiers.Elaborating further, given that the concept classes, \"positive\" and \"negative\" are still the same on unlabeled data, if C1 and C2 are accurate, they would make similar predictions on the unlabeled data. This intuition is the basis for \"consensus maximization\" widely adopted in multiview learning, of which co-training is a special case with two views . The mismatch in predictions by C1 and C2 on unlabeled data can be quantified using a loss function. The squared error loss function commonly used in machine learning captures this loss as:The above formulation captures the average squared-difference in predictions from the two views on unlabeled data. w1 and w2 correspond to the parameter vectors corresponding to C1 and C2, respectively, and u refers to an example from U , having two views, u1 and u2. For a given example, u = (u1, u2), the functions, f1 and f2 act on u1 and u2 respectively, and make the predictions from C1 and C2 comparable. These functions could be generic (e.g. a function that outputs the probability that the instance is positive) or classifier-dependent (for e.g. a function that outputs scaled distances from the separating hyperplane in case of Support Vector Machines). Minimizing L corresponds to adjusting the weight vectors, w1 and w2, so that they make similar predictions on U . In contrast with multiview learning methods, where learning the classifiers is folded into a global objective function in sophisticated ways , we adopt a simpler approach that works off the initial parameter vectors and iteratively modifies them in a \"co-training like\" manner. Note that this initialization plays a crucial role in avoiding trivial solutions (such as w1, w2 = 0) that are potentially possible since the loss is optimized only on unlabeled instances. Our proposed technique for obtaining the \"pair of conforming classifiers\" is described in Algorithm 2.In Algorithm 2, we start with the original parameter vectors w1 and w2 from classifiers C1 and C2, respectively, and iteratively adjust these vectors so that the values of f1(w1, u1) and f2(w2, u2) look similar for all u \u2208 U . The input parameter, #oIters, refers to the number of times the inner loop comprising of the two gradient descent steps is executed, where as, the #iIters, and \u03b1 are parameters for the gradient descent algorithm. Overall, the values of #oIters, #iIters, and \u03b1 control the rate of convergence of the algorithm and can be set experimentally. These parameters can be set based on the base classifiers used, noting when the decrease in the objective function value is below a threshold. Adaptive tuning of these parameters by tracking the change in the value of the objective function in every iteration is a subject for future study .In each iteration, we employ mini-batch gradient descent to minimize the loss function, once w.r.t. w1 and next w.r.t. w2. The mini-batch gradient descent algorithm is a hybrid approach often used for large-scale machine learning problems. This approach combines the best of stochastic (on- line) gradient descent and batch gradient descent to obtain fast convergence during optimization by running gradient descent on small batches of randomly selected examples .In our algorithm, in each iteration, a small batch of instances are randomly sampled from the unlabeled data, U and the loss function defined using instances for which w1 makes confident predictions from this sampled set. This loss is minimized using gradient descent to adjust w2. A similar process is then applied for adjusting w1 using confident predictions from w2. In effect, as the algorithm proceeds, we are adjusting the parameters of each classifier so that it makes predictions that are aligned with those of the other classifier's confident predictions. Upon convergence, both w1 and w2 are adjusted so that they make conforming predictions on the unlabeled data.In our experiments, we used the differentiable, logistic sigmoid function for f1 and f2. Typically, classifiers use the parameter vector, w, for computing decision values for each instance. That is, given an instance x, the dot product value, w, x , is used for determining the label assignment for the instance. This value can be 'squashed' to a number between 0 and 1 indicating that the probability that instance has a particular label with the logistic function [3]: P (t) = 1 1 + e \u2212t with dP (t) dt = P (t) \u00b7 (1 \u2212 P (t)) Given, the simple form for the derivative, we can directly use the values of f1 and f2 (that we compute anyway), for computing the gradients in Algorithm 2. Although the effect obtained by Algorithm 2 is similar to that of co-training, the conformity loss directly measures the effect of co-training as it is being applied. In contrast, Algorithm 1 is typically terminated either when no more examples are available or by tracking the performance on a validation dataset.We provide a preliminary, experimental demonstration of the connection between co-training and our proposed algorithm in Section 5. A more detailed analysis, study of other choices for the loss function L and the functions, f1 and f2, are a subject of future work. Nevertheless, quantifying the discrepancy in predictions from the two views and an algorithm to directly address this aspect is an exciting step in understanding when co-training works. We show in Section 5 that our method can be used in lieu of a validation dataset for tracking the performance of co-training.\nEXPERIMENTSWe discuss 3 types of experiments: First, we study the performance of content-based and URL-based features on the training and validation datasets. Second, we show that co-training can successfully address the problem of mismatch in the training and deployment environments for homepage classification. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 2), achieves the same effect as co-training.

We first propose several collaborative crawling strategies for the geographically focused crawling, whose goal is to collect web pages about specified geographic locations, by considering features like URL address of page, content of page, extended anchor text of link, and others. Later, we propose various evaluation criteria to qualify the performance of such crawling strategies. Finally, we experimentally study our crawling strategies by crawling the real web data showing that some of our crawling strategies greatly outperform the simple URL-hash based partition collaborative crawling, in which the crawling assignments are determined according to the hash-value computation over URLs. More precisely, features like URL address of page and extended anchor text of link are shown to yield the best overall performance for the geographically focused crawling.

URL normalization is to transform duplicate URLs to a canonical form using a set of rewrite rules. Nowadays URL normalization has attracted significant attention as it is lightweight and can be flexibly integrated into both the online (e.g. crawling) and the offline (e.g. index compression) parts of a search engine. To deal with a large scale of websites, automatic approaches are highly desired to learn rewrite rules for various kinds of duplicate URLs. In this paper, we rethink the problem of URL normalization from a global perspective and propose a pattern treebased approach, which is remarkably different from existing approaches. Most current approaches learn rewrite rules by iteratively inducing local duplicate pairs to more general forms, and inevitably suffer from noisy training data and are practically inefficient. Given a training set of URLs partitioned into duplicate clusters for a targeted website, we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm to automatically construct a URL pattern tree. With the pattern tree, the statistical information from all the training samples is leveraged to make the learning process more robust and reliable.

Plenty of valuable information is accumulated based on the check-in behaviors, which makes it possible to learn users' moving patterns as well as their preferences. In LBSNs, point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most significant tasks because it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers provide personalized services. Matrix factorization is a promising method for this task because it can capture users' preferences to locations and is widely adopted in traditional recommender systems such as movie recommendation. However, the sparsity of the check-in data makes it difficult to capture users' preferences accurately. Geographical influence can help alleviate this problem and have a large impact on the final recommendation result. By studying users' moving patterns, we find that users tend to check in around several centers and different users have different numbers of centers. Based on this, we propose a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM) to capture this pattern via modeling the probability of a user's check-in on a location. Moreover, users are usually more interested in the top 20 or even top 10 recommended POIs, which makes personalized ranking important in this task. From previous work, directly optimizing for pairwise ranking like Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) achieves better performance in the top-k recommendation than directly using matrix matrix factorization that aims to minimize the point-wise rating error. To consider users' preferences, geographical influence and personalized ranking, we propose a unified POI recommendation framework, which unifies all of them together.
