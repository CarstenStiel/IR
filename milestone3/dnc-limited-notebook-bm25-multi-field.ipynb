    "Timothy Kriewald: The task of this milestone was to improve the previous milestones (specifically Milestone 2). Therefore, unlike the previous milestones, there were no major issues. Our main task here was to achieve the best possible result for the dataset and the topics through extensive testing. After trying the RM3 and SDM approach, we quickly realised, that these won't improve our results as expected. We decided to extend BM25 using \"Multi Field\". This approach provides a way to easily adjust the scores as desired. The biggest challenge here was to determine which field or approach affects the outcome and how to choose the optimal weighting. All in all, however, this was a significantly smoother milestone that, aside from a few minor hurdles, was much more pleasant compared to the previous milestones.\n",

    "Paul Gresens: Beginning with this task i encountered a lot of technical problems, which I could only partly resolve leading to a situation, where I couldn't help my team as much as I wanted to. Besides these difficulties the whole goal of this assignment seemed o lot clearer, compared to the first too, which helped a lot to understand the assignment itself.\n",

    "Constantin:\n",
    "At the beginning of this milestone, I was at a bit of a loss as to how we could improve on our Retrieval System. At first, we tried using RM3 and SDM which in fact worsened our results. So we quickly pivoted to focusing on the Multi field Retrieval Method, since we could easily and quickly modify the values try it out and repeat. In the end we were able to improve on our earlier result, however our improvements were not as significant as I would have hoped. All in all the more freeform style of this milestone certainly added some a sense of uncertainty but more than that the sense of accomplishment for every improvement felt all the better because of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nils:\n",
    "At the beginning of the task, there was only the baseline retrieval system that needed improvement. We initially implemented different notebooks and observed how the values evolved. Then, we experimented with various weights and methods using the Multi field Notebook.\n",
    "During this milestone, it was enjoyable to try out different approaches and gradually understand the impact of value changes. However, it required quite a bit of work to collect, analyze, and evaluate the different approaches.\n",
    "We encountered some issues in this milestone when we swapped our dataset with the tutors' dataset, as well as with the long loading times when uploading images and using the submission platform.\n",
    "Overall, this task has shown me how exciting it can be to experiment with different values and evaluate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Willi:\n",
    "Having implemented a standard BM25 approach in Milestone 2, we knew the general procedure for implementing different retrieval approaches, which, together with the example notebooks provided, served as a solid tutorial.\n",
    "The RM3 and SDM methods didn't improve our results, so we quickly switched to the Multi field notebook and changed the parameters to try and improve our scores, which we in the end did, even though the changes weren't as significant as we hoped they did. As I didn't do much on this milestone, I can't go into detail about all the problems we encountered, other than the usual ones such as non-functioning installations or problems with Docker.\n",
    "In the end, I liked the freer and more goal-oriented working style of this last submission."
